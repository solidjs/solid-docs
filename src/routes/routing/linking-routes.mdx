title: Linking Routes
---

Once routes have been created within an application, using anchor tags will help users navigate between different views or pages.

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

const Users = lazy(() => import("./pages/Users"));
const Home = lazy(() => import("./pages/Home"));

const App = (props) => (
	<>
		<nav>
			<a href="/about">About</a>
			<a href="/">Home</a>
		</nav>
		<h1>My Site with lots of pages</h1>
		{props.children}
	</>
);

render(
	() => (
		<Router root={App}>
			<Route path="/users" component={Users} />
			<Route path="/" component={Home} />
		</Router>
	),
	document.getElementById("app")
);
```

## `<A>` Component

Solid Router also offers an [`<A>`](/reference/solid-router/components/a) component.
Similar to the HTML anchor tag, the `<A>` component is similar but it supports automatically applying the base URL path and the relative paths.

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route, A } from "@solidjs/router";

const Users = lazy(() => import("./pages/Users"));
const Home = lazy(() => import("./pages/Home"));

const App = (props) => (
	<>
		<nav>
			<A href="/about">About</a>
			<A href="/">Home</a>
		</nav>
		<h1>My Site with lots of pages</h1>
		{props.children}
	</>
);

render(
	() => (
		<Router root={App}>
			<Route path="/users" component={Users} />
			<Route path="/" component={Home} />
		</Router>
	),
	document.getElementById("app")
);
```

In addition, the `<A>` component has an `active` class if its `href` matches the current location, and `inactive` otherwise.
This provides the link with a CSS class to show when the link is active or inactive.

```jsx
<A
	href="/users"
	active="underlined"
	inactive="default"
	>
	About
</A>
```

By default, matching using the `<A>` component includes locations that are _descendants_ (eg. `/users` and `/users/123`).
This component offers the `end` prop, which takes in a boolean to prevent matching these.
This can be useful when links to the root route (`/`) would match everything.
