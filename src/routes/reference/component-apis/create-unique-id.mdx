  Generate unique IDs that are stable across server and client with
  createUniqueId. Essential for accessible forms and SSR-compatible components.
---

The `createUniqueId` function generates a unique ID that remains consistent across both server and client renders.
It is commonly used with HTML `id` and `for` attributes to ensure stable hydration.

It is important to note that `createUniqueId` does not generate a cryptographically secure ID and is not suitable for security-sensitive data.
Additionally, it is not appropriate for scenarios that require uniqueness across a distributed system.

:::note
`createUniqueId` relies on a counter-based mechanism to generate IDs.
It must be called the same number of times on both the server and client.

Calling `createUniqueId` only on the server or only on the client, such as when using [`isServer`](/reference/rendering/is-server) or [`<NoHydration>`](/reference/components/no-hydration), may lead to hydration errors.
