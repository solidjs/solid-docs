:::note
This guide is for Tailwind CSS v4. For **Tailwind CSS v3** refer to [Tailwind CSS v3](/guides/styling-components/tailwind-v3).
:::

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is an on-demand utility CSS library that integrates seamlessly with Solid as a built-in PostCSS plugin.

## Installation

1. Install Tailwind CSS as a development dependency:

```package-install-dev
tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```

2. Add `@tailwind/postcss` to the `plugins` in your PostCSS configuration. If you do not have a PostCSS configuration file, create a new one called `postcss.config.mjs`.

```js title="postcss.config.mjs"
export default {
	plugins: {
		"@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
	}
}
```

For a deeper dive into configuration, you can check out the [Tailwind Official Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

## Import Tailwind CSS

Add an `@import` to your `src/index.css` file that imports Tailwind CSS.

```css title="src/index.css"
@import "tailwindcss";
```


## Import your CSS file

Import your `index.css` file into the root `index.jsx` or `index.tsx` file:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web"
import App from "./App"
import "./index.css"

render(() => <App />, document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement);
```

## Usage

With Tailwind CSS set up, you can now utilize its utility classes.
For instance, if you previously had a `Card.css` file, you can replace or remove it:

```
/* src/components/Card.css */
/* Remove or replace these styles with Tailwind utility classes */
```

Update your components to use Tailwind's utility classes:

```jsx
/* src/components/Card.jsx */
function Card() {
	return (
		<div class="grid place-items-center min-h-screen">
			<div class="h-[160px] aspect aspect-[2] rounded-[16px] shadow-[0_0_0_4px_hsl(0_0%_0%_/_15%)]">
				Hello, world!
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}
```
