title: "Rendering Modes"
---

SolidStart has 3 kinds of rendering modes: `sync`, `async`, and `stream`.
Let's talk about how each of them work and which one to pick.

:::note
Default is **stream** and performance-wise should be preferred as a rule-of-thumb.
:::

All modes have some degree of Server-Side Rendering, you may need to change them globally depending on your deployment provider.
And you may prefer to override them for better bot support and SEO.

## Impacted Features

| Feature              | sync        | async                       | stream                  |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Data fetching        | Client-side | Server-side (blocking)      | Server-side (streaming) |
| Suspense fallbacks   | Yes         | No                          | Yes                     |
| Time to first byte   | Fast        | Slower (waits for all data) | Faster                  |
| Total page load time | Slower      | Fast (server fetches)       | Faster (progressive)    |

### Sync Mode

Uses [`renderToString`](/reference/rendering/render-to-string) to render the page from Solid's core to render the page synchronously.
All async features are disabled and the page is rendered as soon as possible and sent to the client-side where data fetching will happen post-hydration.

### Async Mode

Uses [`renderToStringAsync`](/reference/rendering/render-to-string-async) to render the page from Solid's core to render the page asynchronously.
All Suspense boundaries are resolved and rendered before being sent to the client-side.

No suspense fallbacks are shown in the browser, which makes this mode ideal for SEO optimizations and bot support.

### Stream Mode

Uses [`renderToStream`](/reference/rendering/render-to-stream) to render the page from Solid's core to render the page streaming.
Leveraging [TransformableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream) to progressively send the HTML to the client-side.

This mode is ideal for performance and future-friendly apps.

## Global Configuration

The modes can be defined app-wide via the configuration file or via the [`entry-server.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/entry-server) file.

```tsx title="app.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
	mode: "stream",
});
```

The value in [`entry-server.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/entry-server) overrides the value in [`app.config.ts`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/app-config).

```tsx title="src/entry-server.tsx"
import { createHandler, StartServer } from "@solidjs/start/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
	<StartServer document={...} />
), {
	mode: "async"
});
```

## Per-Route Configuration

The optional secondary parameter in [`createHandler`](/solid-start/reference/server/create-handler) can be an object or a function that receives the `RequestEvent` and returns an object with the mode to use for the route.

```tsx title="src/entry-server.tsx"
import { createHandler, StartServer } from "@solidjs/start/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
	<StartServer document={...} />
), {
	mode: (event) => {
		return { mode: event.request.url.includes("/special-route") ? "async" : "stream" };
	}
});
```

It can also be used for bot detection via the `userAgent` property of the `RequestEvent`.

```tsx title="src/entry-server.tsx"
import { createHandler, StartServer } from "@solidjs/start/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
	<StartServer document={...} />
), {
	mode: (event) => {
		return isBot(event.request.userAgent) ? "async" : "stream";
	}
});
```
