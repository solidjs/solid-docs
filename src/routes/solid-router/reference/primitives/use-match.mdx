title: useMatch
---

`useMatch` takes an accessor that returns the path and creates a Memo that returns match information if the current path matches the provided path.
Useful for determining if a given path matches the current route.

```js
const match = useMatch(() => props.href);

return <div classList={{ active: Boolean(match()) }} />;
```

As a second parameter, `useMatch` also accepts a group of `MatchFilters`.
These filters allow for a more granular check.

The filters are the same used by the `<Router>` itself and they accept either a an array of strings, or a regular expression. Additionally, there's a `boolean` option to match a route only if it has, or doesn't have, the HTML extension.

```js
const filters: MatchFilters = {
  parent: ["mom", "dad"]
  id: /^\d+$/,
  withHtmlExtension: (v: string) => v.length > 5 && v.endsWith(".html")
};
```

Finally, any parameter can be determined optional by adding a `?` at the end of the parameter name.

```js
	const isReference = useMatch(() => "/:project?/reference/*?", {
		project: ["solid-router", "solid-meta", "solid-start"],
	});
```

The check above will match:

```text
/reference
/solid-router/reference
/solid-meta/reference
/solid-start/reference

/reference/...
/solid-router/reference/...
/solid-meta/reference/...
/solid-start/reference/...
```
