Stores are a state management primitive in Solid that provide a convenient, centralized way to handle structured data.
Unlike signals, which are best suited for primitive values, stores are better for managing complex data structures like objects and arrays:

- They provide fine-grained reactivity, meaning only the parts of the store that are accessed will trigger updates when they change.
- They support **nested reactivity,** so you can track and update deeply nested properties without losing reactivity.
- They make working with complex state easier while avoiding duplication or unnecessary recomputation.

Stores are built on top of Solid's reactive system, leveraging [JavaScript's proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) to track property access and changes.

## Creating a Store

To create a store, you can use the `createStore` function from the `solid-js/store` package. 
This function takes an initial value and returns a tuple containing the store and a setter function to update it.

```tsx
import { createStore } from "solid-js/store"

// Initialize store
const [store, setStore] = createStore({
	userCount: 3,
	users: [
		{
			id: 0,
			username: "felix909",
			location: "England",
			loggedIn: false,
		},
		{
			id: 1,
			username: "tracy634",
			location: "Canada",
			loggedIn: true,
		},
		{
			id: 2,
			username: "johny123",
			location: "India",
			loggedIn: true,
		},
	],
})
```

## Accessing store values

Unlike signals, which are functions that need to be called to get their values, stores can be accessed directly like regular objects or arrays.

```tsx
console.log(store.userCount) // 3
```

Inside a tracking scope, store properties can be accessed directly, and any changes to those properties will trigger updates to the scope.

:::note

Stores create signals **lazily**.
This means that a property only becomes reactive once accessed inside a tracking scope.

```tsx
const App = () => {
	const [mySignal, setMySignal] = createSignal("This is a signal.")
	const [store, setStore] = createStore({
		userCount: 3,
		users: [
			{
				id: 0,
				username: "felix909",
				location: "England",
				loggedIn: false,
			},
			{
				id: 1,
				username: "tracy634",
				location: "Canada",
				loggedIn: true,
			},
			{
				id: 2,
				username: "johny123",
				location: "India",
				loggedIn: true,
			},
		],
	})
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello, {store.users[0].username}</h1> {/* Accessing a store value */}
			<span>{mySignal()}</span> {/* Accessing a signal */}
		</div>
	)
}
```
