[LESS](https://lesscss.org/) is a preprocessor based on JavaScript.
It provides the ability to use mixins, variables, and other programmatic tools, making styling code cleaner and less redundant.

## Installation

To utilize LESS in a Solid app, it will need to be installed as a development dependency:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm i --save-dev less
```
</div>

<div id="yarn">
```bash frame="none"
yarn add --dev less 
```
</div>

<div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm add --dev less
```
</div>

<div id="bun">
```bash frame="none"
bun add --dev less
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

## Using LESS in your app

Start by creating a `.less` file in the `src` directory:

```less
//styles.less
.foo {
	color: red;
}
.bar {
	background-color: blue;
}
```

The basic syntax of LESS is very similar to CSS.
However, LESS allows the declaration and usage of variables:

```less
//styles.less
@plainred: red;
@plainblue: blue;
.foo {
	color: @plainred;
}
.bar {
	background-color: @plainblue;
}
```

To use these styles in a Solid component, import the `.less` file:

```jsx
//component.jsx
import "./styles.less";

function Component() {
	return (
		<>
			<div class="foo bar">Hello, world!</div>
		</>
	);
}
```

By changing the file extension of the imported styles to `.less`, Vite will recognize it as a LESS file and compile it to CSS on demand.
