The `createHandler` is used to start the server in [`entry-server.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/entry-server).
It takes a function that returns a static document (often created with [`<StartServer>`](/solid-start/reference/server/start-server)), renders, and serves it.

:::note
To fully understand how to leverage different rendering modes, please refer to the [Rendering Modes](/solid-start/building-your-application/rendering-modes) page.
:::

A `createHandler` is essential to every SolidStart app.
To fallback the rendering mode to the [`app.config.ts`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/app-config-ts) definition (or the default "stream" mode), you can use the `createHandler` without any options.

```tsx title="src/entry-server.tsx"
import { createHandler, StartServer } from "@solidjs/start/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
  <StartServer document={...}
  />
));
```

It is also possible to [override the rendering mode for a specific route](/solid-start/building-your-application/rendering-modes#per-route-configuration).

## Type Signature

```tsx
type RenderingModes = "stream" | "async" | "sync";

function createHandler(
	handler: () => (document: any, options?: any) => void,
	options?:
		| { mode?: RenderingModes }
		| ((event: RequestEvent) => { mode: RenderingModes })
		| undefined
): (event: RequestEvent) => Response;
```
