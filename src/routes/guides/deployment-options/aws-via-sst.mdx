  Deploy SolidStart apps to AWS Lambda or containers using SST framework with
  streamlined configuration and deployment.

[SST](https://sst.dev/) is a framework for deploying applications to any cloud provider. It has a built-in way to deploy SolidStart apps to AWS Lambda. For additional details, you can [visit their docs](https://sst.dev/docs/).

## Quick start

1. [Create a SolidStart app](/solid-start/getting-started).

2. In your project, init SST.

```package-exec
sst@latest init
```

3. This will detect your SolidStart app and ask you to update your `app.config.ts`.

```ts title="app.config.ts"
server: {
   preset: "aws-lambda-streaming"
}
```

4. When you are ready, you can deploy your app using:

```package-exec
sst@latest deploy --stage production
```

You can [read the full tutorial on the SST docs](https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/solid).

## Deploy to a Container

You can also deploy your SolidStart app to a [container](https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/solid#containers) using SST.
