`Route` is the component used when defining the routes of an application.
This component is used to define the structure of the application and the components that will be rendered for each route.

:::note[Multiple paths]
Routes support defining multiple paths using an array.
This is useful for when you want a route to remain mounted and not re-render when switching between two or more locations that it matches:

```jsx
<Route path={["/login", "/register"]} component={Login} />
```

This would mean navigating from `/login` to `/register` would not cause the `Login` component to re-render.
