The `innerHTML` attribute is equivalent to the [`innerHTML` DOM property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML).
This attribute replaces all existing nodes of the element with new nodes generated by parsing the provided string as HTML.

:::caution

Using `innerHTML` with unsanitized user-supplied data can introduce security vulnerabilities.
