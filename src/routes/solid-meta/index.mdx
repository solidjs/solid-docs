# Overview

Solid Meta offers asynchronous SSR-ready Document Head management for Solid Applications, based on [React Head](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head)

With Solid Meta, you can define `document.head` tags at any level of your component hierarchy. This helps you to manage tags conveniently, especially when contextual information for specific tags are buried deep within your component hierarchy.

This library has no dependencies and is designed to seamlessly integrate with asynchronous rendering.
