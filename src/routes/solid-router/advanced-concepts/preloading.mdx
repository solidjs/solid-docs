title: Preloading
---

When using the [`<A>`](/solid-router/reference/components/a) component from Solid Router, routes are preloaded by default on link hover/focus to improve perceived performance.

To enhance preloading, you can define the `preload` function on your route definition.
When on a [SolidStart](/solid-start) application, this function can also run on the server during the initial page load to fetch data before rendering. When in a Single-Page Application (SPA), it will load the route's component and its `preload` function when the user hovers or focuses on a link.

| user action | route behavior                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| hover   | with a 300ms delay to avoid excessive preloading  |
| focus   | immediately                           |

## Imperative Preloading

You can also use the [`usePreloadRoute`](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-preload-route) helper to preload routes programmatically in response to events other than link hover/focus, such as button clicks or timers.
This helper will load only the route's component by default, but it can receive a configuration object to also load the data.

## Preloading and Lazy Loading

When a route has nested lazy components, such components will not be part of the route hierarchy, so they **will not** be preloaded with the route. To preload such components, you can use the [`usePreloadRoute`](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-preload-route) helper in the parent component to load them when needed.
