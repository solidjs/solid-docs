# Welcome

Welcome to the Solid tutorial! In this tutorial, you'll learn Solid by doing&mdash;we'll build an app and explore Solid principles along the way.

## What is Solid?

Solid is a JavaScript framework for making interactive web applications. With Solid, you can use your existing HTML and JavaScript knowledge to build components that can be reused throughout your app. Solid provides the tools to enhance your components with reactivity: declarative JavaScript code that links the user interface with the data that it uses and creates.

## Prerequisites

Before digging into Solid, we recommend you have some experience building websites and a working understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

  Solid](/learn/getting-started-with-solid/javascript-for-solid) if you need a
  refresher on JavaScript concepts we frequently use in Solid.
