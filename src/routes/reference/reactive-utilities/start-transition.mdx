  Start transitions in SolidJS without pending state tracking. Batch async
  updates for improved performance and smoother user interactions.

```ts
import { startTransition } from "solid-js"

function startTransition: (fn: () => void) => Promise<void>

```

Similar to `useTransition` except there is no associated pending state. 
This one can just be used directly to start the Transition.
