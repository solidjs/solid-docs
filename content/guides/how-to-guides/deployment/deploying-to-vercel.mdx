<Title>Deploying To Vercel</Title>

Here we're going to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) to deploy our Solid.js project. 

If you haven't heard of Vercel, it's a platform where developers can host their frontend projects. For more information on Vercel and what they do make sure to visit their [website](https://vercel.com/home).

## Connecting Vercel with Your Online Git Repository

With Vercel you can make use of GitHub's continuous development actions. When connecting Vercel with your GitHub repo there's no further configuration that needs to be done in order to host and update the site on Vercel, Vercel automatically detects pushes to the branch specified and builds the project based on the commands specified within the `package.json`.

Here's a quick step by step guide to get your Solid.js online repo code up and running on Vercel

**Note:** We will be making use of GitHub as an example.

**Step 1:** Log into or sign up on Vercel using your GitHub account. The log in page should look similar to this.

**Step 2:** Add a new project to your Vercel account. Once logged in you will be redirected to a dashboard. In that dashboard click on the button at the top right corner and select `Add New Project`. 

From there you will be redirected to page that looks similar to this

select `Continue with GitHub`, but feel free to use whichever online repository service you make use of that is also offered here.

**Step 3:** Next you should see a list of some of your repos, if not you can make use of the search bar to search for a particular one.

Once you've chosen a repository, just click on the `import` button.

**Final Step:** Once you've imported your Solid.js project repository you will be redirected to this screen

Just hit deploy and you're all set. If you have any environment variables make sure to add them to the environment variables field.

Once it's done building and deploying you will be redirected to this screen

clicking on the generated image will lead you to your live Solid.js project.
