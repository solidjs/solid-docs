WE'RE WORKING ON THIS :)

# Contributing to the Solid Docs

- Background: why we're redoing the docs and how (Diataxis). Link to frontpage

## Who we're looking for

You!

- Writers
- Designers
- ...

## How we work

- Discussions can take place on Discord (#docs) but...
- Any proposal / new idea must be an issue
- Any bug must be reported as an issue
- This allows us to assign tasks and prioritize them
- We use a Github Project board for task management

### Governance

Anyone is encouraged to contribute to the project through issue creation, volunteering to take a task, PRs (whether or not they correspond to an existing task), and Discord discussions.

Anyone who makes a contribution to the docs repository or community is a Docs Contributor. (probably a Green Discord role.) Credit on the site.

The Docs Team has GitHub permissions and exists to:

- product "leads" -> ultimate responsibility
- Support the Contributors
- Handle merges
- Handle deployment
- Liasion with the Solid Core Team and Ecosystem Team
- "Final Say" - let's justify this -> moving things along
