As a non-opinionated framework, SolidStart doesn't enforce any security practices, though it enables developers to implement them as needed.
It is important to know what are the requirements for your own app and implement the fitting security measures.
If at any point you are unsure about the security of your app, or how to achieve something within the constraints of SolidStart reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/solidjs).

Below you will find a few notes on how to establish some measures.

## Security Headers

Through the use of a [middleware](/solid-start/reference/server/create-middleware#example) it is possible to tab into the `onRequest` event handlers and make sure every request going through your servers have the proper security headers set.
With this, it is possible to setup headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, among others.

### Nonces

When using `Content-Security-Policy` it is possible to use nonces to allow inline scripts and styles to be executed.
SolidStart enables that smoothly in the [`entry-server.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/entry-server).

By passing generating the `nonce` within a middleware and storing it in the `request.locals` object, it is possible to use it in the `entry-server.tsx` to generate the `Content-Security-Policy` header.

## Cross Request Forgery (CSRF)

There are multiple ways to add CSRF Protection to your SolidStart app.
The quickest and most common way is to check the `request.referrer` header when the HTTP method is `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE`.
This can also be achieved through an `onRequest` [middleware](/solid-start/reference/server/create-middleware#example).

## Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

SolidStart automatically escape inserts and attributes in HTML.
The exception is when HTML is inserted via the `innerHTML` property, which bypasses the escaping.
Additionally, it's important to note that `<noscript>` are also outside of the purview of SolidStart, since those tags and its contents are evaluated even without JavaScript.
It is important to sanitize any strings in attributes, especially when inside `<noscript>` tags.

As a rule-of-thumb it is recommended to avoid injecting HTML into your page as much as possible, make sure the contents of `<noscript>` are properly sanitized, and add a strict Content Security Policy to your application.
