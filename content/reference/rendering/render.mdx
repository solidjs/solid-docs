title: render
---

```ts
import type { JSX, MountableElement } from "solid-js/web"

function render(code: () => JSX.Element, element: MountableElement): () => void

```

This is the browser app entry point. 
Provide a top-level component function and an element to mount to. 
It is recommended this element be empty: while `render` will just append children, the returned dispose function will remove all children.

```ts
const dispose = render(App, document.getElementById("app"))
// or
const dispose = render(() => <App />, document.getElementById("app"))
```

It's important that the first argument is a function: do not pass JSX directly (as in `render(<App/>, ...)`), because this will call App before render can set up a root to track signal dependencies within App.
