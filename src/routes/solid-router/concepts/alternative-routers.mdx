title: Alternative Routers
---

Outside of the default browser router, Solid Router also provides hash and memory routers for different use cases.

## Hash Mode Router

By default, Solid Router uses `location.pathname` as route path.
You can simply switch to hash mode through the `source` property on `<Router>` component.

```jsx
import { HashRouter } from "@solidjs/router";

<HashRouter />;
```

## Memory Mode Router

You can also use [`MemoryRouter`](/solid-router/reference/components/memory-router) for testing purpose.

```jsx
import { MemoryRouter } from "@solidjs/router";

<MemoryRouter />;
```
