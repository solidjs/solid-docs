title: batch

```ts
import { batch } from "solid-js"

function batch<T>(fn: () => T): T
```

`batch` is a low-level API that batches updates together.
More precisely, `batch(fn)` holds the execution of downstream computations
during the `fn` block, executing them all together once the block `fn` returns.
Thus, instead of a downstream computation executing after every dependency
update, it will update just once at the end of the batch.

Batching improves performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculation.
Suppose you have a downstream memo `down` that depends on
multiple upstream signals `up1`, `up2`, and `up3`:

```ts
import { createSignal, createMemo, createEffect } from "solid-js"
const [up1, setUp1] = createSignal(1)
const [up2, setUp2] = createSignal(2)
const [up3, setUp3] = createSignal(3)
const down = createMemo(() => up1() + up2() + up3())
// For illustration, monitor when `down` gets recomputed:
createEffect(() => console.log(down())) // outputs 6
```

If you directly update all of the upstream signals outside of batch mode,
then `down` will recompute every time.

```ts
setUp1(4) // recomputes down, outputs 9
setUp2(5) // recomputes down, outputs 12
setUp3(6) // recomputes down, outputs 15
```

If instead you update the upstream signals within a `batch`, then `down`
will update only once at the end:

```ts
batch(() => {
  setUp1(10) // doesn't update down yet
  setUp2(10) // doesn't update down yet
  setUp3(10) // doesn't update down yet
}) // recomputes down, outputs 30
```

The impact is even more dramatic if you have *m* downstream computations
(memos, effects, etc.) that each depend on *n* upstream signals.
Without batching, modifying all *n* upstream signals
would cause *m n* updates to the downstream computations.
With batching, modifying all *n* upstream signals
would cause *m* updates to the downstream computations.
Given that each update takes at least *n* time
(just to read the upstream signals), this cost savings can be significant.
Batching is also especially helpful when the downstream effects include
DOM updates, which can be expensive.

Solid uses `batch` internally to automatically batch updates for you
in a few cases:

* Within [`createEffect`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-effect)
  and [`onMount`](/reference/lifecycle/on-mount)
* Within the [setter of a store](/reference/store-utilities/create-store#setter)
  (which can update several properties at once)
* Within array methods (e.g. `Array.prototype.splice`) of a
  [mutable store](/reference/store-utilities/create-mutable)
  (which can update several elements at once)

These save you from having to use `batch` yourself in many cases.
For the most part, automatic batching should be transparent to you,
because accessing a memo will cause it to recompute if it is out of date.
For example:

```ts
batch(() => {
  setUp1(11) // doesn't update down yet
  setUp2(11) // doesn't update down yet
  setUp3(11) // doesn't update down yet
  console.log(down()) // recomputes down, outputs 33
  setUp1(12) // doesn't update down yet
  setUp2(12) // doesn't update down yet
  setUp3(12) // doesn't update down yet
}) // recomputes down, outputs 36
```

You can think of `batch(fn)` as setting a global "batch mode" variable,
calling the function `fn`, and then restoring the global variable to its
previous value.
This means that you can nest `batch` calls, and they will form one big batch.
It also means that, if `fn` is asynchronous,
only the updates before the first `await` will be batched.
