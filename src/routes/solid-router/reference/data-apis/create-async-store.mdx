  Create deeply reactive stores from async data sources for fine-grained updates

Similar to [createAsync](/solid-router/reference/data-apis/create-async) except it uses a deeply reactive store. Perfect for applying fine-grained changes to large model data that updates.

```jsx
const todos = createAsyncStore(() => getTodos());
```
