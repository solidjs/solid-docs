# Deployment Options

Are you ready to deploy your Solid application? Follow our guides for different deployment services.

## AWS via Flightcontrol

[Flightcontrol](https://www.flightcontrol.dev/) is a platform that fully automates deployments to Amazon Web Services (AWS).
For more information on Flightcontrol's capabilities, you can [visit their docs](https://www.flightcontrol.dev/docs).

### Connecting to a git repository

Flightcontrol offers a GitHub integration, leveraging its continuous development actions. 

To get started with Flightcontrol's GitHub integration, you'll first need to log in or sign up to the Flightcontrol platform. 
After you're logged in, simply link your GitHub account to Flightcontrol.

Once connected, Flightcontrol will take care of the rest. 
It automatically detects any new pushes to your specified GitHub branches and builds your project.
The build process uses the commands in your `package.json` file and adheres to the settings that you have configured in Flightcontrol.
No additional setup is needed.

```
{
  "$schema": "https://app.flightcontrol.dev/schema.json",
  "environments": [
    {
      "id": "production",
      "name": "Production",
      "region": "us-west-2",
      "source": {
        "branch": "main"
      },
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "my-static-solid",
          "buildType": "nixpacks",
          "name": "My static solid site",
          "type": "static",
          "domain": "solid.yourapp.com",
          "outputDirectory": "dist",
          "singlePageApp": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


## Cloudflare

[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) is a JAMstack platform for frontend developers, where JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. 
For additional details and features, you can [visit the Cloudflare website](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

### Using the Cloudflare's web interface

1. Navigate to the [Cloudflare login page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login) and log in or sign up.

[](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/w9y9PNVjwSqDCEPNTEoe?elements=UE1AFe5oESDQkepKNaMxtA)

2.  After logging in, find "Pages" in the left-hand navigation bar. 
Add a new project by clicking "Create a project," then choose "Connect to Git."

[](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/w9y9PNVjwSqDCEPNTEoe?elements=XcbVyX2a69kSAP1m1220Ug)

3.  You'll have the option to install Cloudflare Pages on all your repositories or select ones. 
Choose the repository that contains your Solid project.

[](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/w9y9PNVjwSqDCEPNTEoe?elements=SsbGUghc_Vwlvxefe1xAFg)

4. Configure your build settings:
- The project name will default to the repository name, but you can change it if you wish.
- In the "build command" field, enter `npm run build` .
- For the "build output directory" field, use `dist` . 
- Add an environment variable `NODE_VERSION` and set its value to the version of Node.js you're using.

**Note:** This step is crucial because Cloudflare Pages uses a version of Node.js older than v13, which may not fully support Vite, the bundler used in Solid projects.

[](https://app.eraser.io/workspace/w9y9PNVjwSqDCEPNTEoe?elements=1HpIQUkxqNl9j3JlXIUvTg)

5. Once you've configured the settings, click "Save and Deploy."
In a few minutes, your Solid project will be live on Cloudflare Pages, accessible via a URL formatted as `project_name.pages.dev`.

### Using the Wrangler CLI

Wrangler is a command-line tool for building Cloudflare Workers.
Here are the steps to deploy your Solid project using Wrangler.

1. Use your package manager of choice to install the Wrangler command-line tool:

```bash
npm i -g wrangler 
# or
pnpm i -g wrangler 
# or 
yarn global add wrangler
```

2. Open your terminal and run the following command to log in:

```bash
wrangler login
```

3. Execute the following commands to build your project and deploy it using Wrangler:

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler pages publish dist
```

After running these commands, your project should be live. 
While the terminal may provide a link, it's more reliable to check your Cloudflare Pages dashboard for the deployed URL, which usually follows the format `project-name.pages.dev`.


**Note:** 
Make sure to navigate to the `Speed` -> `Optimization settings` section in your Cloudflare website dashboard and disable the `Auto Minify` option. 
This is important as minification and comment removal can interfere with hydration.

## Railway

[Railway](https://railway.app/) is a well-known platform for deploying a variety of web and cloud-based projects. 
For an in-depth look at the features offered by Railway, as well as detailed deployment guidelines, you can consult the [Railway documentation](https://docs.railway.app/).

### Adjust the Start command

To begin, you need to update the start command in your `package.json` file to make it compatible with Railway. 
Change the start command to `npx http-server ./dist` instead of using `vite`. 
This adjustment means you will need to build the app to generate the `dist` folder.

For local development, continue using the original `dev` command.
Reserve the modified start command specifically for Railway deployments. 
Below is an example of how your `package.json` may be configured:

```jsonl
"scripts": {
  "start": "npx http-server ./dist",
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "serve": "vite preview",
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
},
```

### Using the Railway Web Interface

1. Visit Railway's homepage and click "Start a New Project."
You will be redirected to connect with GitHub. 
Log in or create an account using your GitHub credentials and authorize Railway to access your account.
