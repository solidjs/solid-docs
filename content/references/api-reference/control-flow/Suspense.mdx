<Title>{"<Suspense>"}</Title>

A component that tracks all resources read under it and shows a fallback placeholder state until they are resolved. What makes `Suspense` different than `Show` is it is non-blocking in that both branches exist at the same time even if not currently in the DOM. This means that the fallback can be rendered while the children are loading. This is useful for loading states and other asynchronous operations.

```ts
function Suspense(props: {
  fallback?: JSX.Element;
  children: JSX.Element;
}): JSX.Element;
```

Here's an example of a `Suspense` component that shows a loading spinner while the `User` component is loading.

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner/>}>
  <AsyncComponent />
</Suspense>
```
