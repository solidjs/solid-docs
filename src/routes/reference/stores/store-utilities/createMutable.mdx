## createMutable

```tsx
function createMutable<T extends StoreNode>(state: T | Store<T>): Store<T>;
```

Creates a new mutable Store proxy object.
Stores only trigger updates on values changing.
Tracking is done by intercepting property access and automatically tracks deep nesting via proxy.

Useful for integrating external systems or as a compatibility layer with MobX/Vue.

<Callout>
	A mutable state can be passed around and mutated anywhere, which can make it
	harder to follow and easier to break unidirectional flow. It is generally
	recommended to use createStore instead. The produce modifier can give many of
	the same benefits without any of the downsides.
</Callout>

```tsx
import { createMutable } from "solid-js/store";

const state = createMutable({
	someValue: 0,
	list: [],
});

// read value
state.someValue;

// set value
state.someValue = 5;

state.list.push(anotherValue);
```

Mutables support setters along with getters.

```tsx
const user = createMutable({
	firstName: "John",
	lastName: "Smith",
	get fullName() {
		return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
	},
	set setFullName(value) {
		[this.firstName, this.lastName] = value.split(" ");
	},
});
```
