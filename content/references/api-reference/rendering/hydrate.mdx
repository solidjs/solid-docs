<Title>hydrate</Title>

```ts
function hydrate(fn: () => JSX.Element, node: MountableElement): () => void;
```

This method is similar to __render__ except it attempts to rehydrate what is already rendered to the DOM. When initializing in the browser a page has already been server rendered.

```ts
const dispose = hydrate(App, document.getElementById("app"));
```
