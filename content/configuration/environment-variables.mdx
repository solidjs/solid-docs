# Setting Up Environment Variables

Solid is built on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which offers a convenient way to handle environment variables. 
The following steps will show how to set up environment varaibles in a Solid project:

1. In the root directory of the project, create a file called `.env`. 
This file will store environment variables in the `key = value` format.

<Aside>
To prevent accidental exposure of environment variables to the client, only variables prefixed with `VITE_` will be exposed.

For example:

```json
VITE_SECRET_KEY = 123hello
DB_PASSWORD = foobar
```

Only the `VITE_SECRET_KEY` will be exposed to client source code, while `DB_PASSWORD` will not, as shown below.

```jsx
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SECRET_KEY) // 123hello
console.log(import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD) // undefined
```

</Aside>
    
2. In your Solid code, you can use <code class="text-sm">import.meta.env</code> to access your environment variables.
Vite will automatically inject the environment variables into your application.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Component with environment variable used {import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME}</h2>
    </div>
  )
}
export default MyComponent;
```
