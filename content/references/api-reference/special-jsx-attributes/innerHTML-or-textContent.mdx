<Title>innerHTML or textContent</Title>

These work the same as their property equivalent. Set a string and they will be set. __Be careful!!__ Setting `innerHTML` with any data that could be exposed to an end user as it could be a vector for malicious attack. `textContent` while generally not needed is actually a performance optimization when you know the children will only be text as it bypasses the generic diffing routine.

```tsx
<div textContent={state.text} />
```
