Redirects to the next route.
When done over a server RPC call, the redirect will be done through the server.
By default the status code of a `redirect()` is `302 - FOUND`, also known as a temporary redirect.

Other useful redirect codes:

| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `301` | Moved Permanently |
| `307` | Temporary Redirect |
| `308` | Permanent redirect |

<Callout type="tip" name="Redirect Methods">
307 and 308 won't allow the browser to change the method of the request. If you want to change the method, you should use 301 or 302.
</Callout>

A common use-case for a throwing a redirect is when a user is not authenticated and you want to redirect them to the login page.

```js title="/queries/get-user.ts" {7}
import { query, redirect } from "@solidjs/router";
import { getCurrentUser } from "../auth";

const getUser = query(() => {
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  
  if (!user) throw redirect("/login");
  
  return user;
}, "get-user")
```

## Single-Flight Mutations

When using `redirect` during a Server Action, the redirect will be done through the server.
The response value will automatically send data for the destination route, avoiding a subsequent roundtrip to load the data from the target route.

This is useful when you want to redirect the user to a different route after a mutation has been done.

```ts title="/actions/add-user.ts" {3,6}
import { action, redirect } from "@solidjs/router";

const addUser = action(async (user: User) => {
  await postUser(user);
  
  return redirect("/users");
});
```

The `addUser` action will redirect the user to the `/users` route once the user has been added to the database.
And the response from the form action will automatically send the updated data for the `/users` route without the developer needing to revalidate or reload.

## Throw vs Return

Both `throw` and `return` can be used to redirect the user to a different route.
Generally, `throw` is used when you want to immediately stop the execution of the current action and redirect the user, making it the most recommended way.

When returning from a nested method, the parent method will continue to execute, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

### TypeScript Signature

```typescript
interface ResponseOptions {
  revalidate?: string | string[];
} | number

function redirect(url: string, opts = 302): CustomResponse<never>;
```
