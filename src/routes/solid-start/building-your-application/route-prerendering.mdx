Route pre-rendering powers Static Site Generation (SSG) by producing static HTML pages during the build process.
This results in faster load times and better SEO, making it especially useful for content-rich sites such as documentation, blogs, and marketing pages.
Static files are served without server-side processing at runtime.

Configure prerendering for specific routes using the `routes` option

```js { 6 }
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    prerender: {
      routes: ["/", "/about"]
    }
  }
});
```

Or to pre-render all routes, you can pass `true` to the `crawlLinks` option

```js { 6 }
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    prerender: {
      crawlLinks: true
    }
  }
});
```

For advanced pre-rendering options, refer to [Nitro's documentation](https://nitro.build/config#prerender).

[SolidBase](https://solidbase.dev) simplifies SSG development with built-in support for fast, pre-rendered Markdown and MDX pages.
