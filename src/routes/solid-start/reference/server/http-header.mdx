title: HttpHeader
---

`HttpHeader` provides a way to set headers on HTTPs response sent by the server.

```tsx
import { HttpHeader } from "@solidjs/start";

<HttpHeader name="x-robots-tag" value="noindex" />;
```

## Setting a header for catch-all routes

```tsx title="routes/*404.tsx"
import { HttpHeader, HttpStatusCode } from "@solidjs/start";

export default function NotFound() {
	return (
		<div>
			<HttpStatusCode code={404} />
			<HttpHeader name="my-header" value="header-value" />
		</div>
	);
}
```

As a page is rendered, you may want to add additional HTTP headers to the response and the `HttpHeader` component will do that for you. 
By passing it a `name` and `value`, they will get added to the `Response` headers sent back to the browser.

When streaming responses with [`renderToStream`](/reference/rendering/render-to-stream), HTTP headers can only be added before the stream is first flushed.
This requires adding `deferStream` to any resources that need to be loaded before responding.
