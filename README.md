# Solid Docs

![Tests](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)

This is the working repository for our new docs effort. The infrastructure is built on [SolidStart](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start) and the content structure and goals are inspired by [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) and the [React Beta Docs.](https://diataxis.fr/)

## Running the Site

Our [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/solidjs/solid-docs-next/) or [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next) or links are the quickest way to set up a development environment, which lets you browse and edit the project files and run the resulting site locally.

We use **npm** as our a package manager. If you [clone this project](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) locally, [install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), then run these commands to start the project:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The Solid Docs Manifesto

1. <h4>Documentation is a product.</h4> A product has users, and product teams design, engineer, and maintain solutions that serve them. We’re not writing text that describes SolidJS, we’re using everything at our disposal to teach SolidJS and empower our users throughout the learning process.

2. <h4>Documentation is <em>the product</em>.</h4> Solid's user experience depends on the docs. Solid is not an independent project from its docs, and docs are a core concern for the Solid team. We care about the entire onboarding and learning experience, from your first time installing the library from your first dive into Solid's source code.

3. <h4>Documentation is inclusive and collaborative.</h4> We prioritize inclusion because good design is inclusive. Docs should be written for and by folks of different perspectives, backgrounds, and level of tech expertise. We aim to foster an environment where every voice is heard.


4. <h4>Documentation is accessible.</h4> Learning SolidJS should be possible for anyone. At their best, docs break down barriers and create new opportunities. To do that, we must accomodate all learners. Beyond accessible text, docs include code examples, videos, and drawings, so we can support different needs and learning styles.

5. <h4>Documentation is fun.</h4> It feels and should feel amazing to learn a new skill; let's make sure it feels fun to teach it. We’re a community of volunteers, and that community matters: we care about our users, and we care about each other.
