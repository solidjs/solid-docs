title: createMiddleware
---

`createMiddleware` creates a configuration object for SolidStart that specifies when middleware functions are executed during the request lifecycle.

There are two lifecycle events available: `onRequest` and `onBeforeResponse`.

- The `onRequest` event is triggered at the beginning of the request lifecycle, before the request is handled by the route handler.
- The `onBeforeResponse` event is triggered after a request has been processed by the route handler but before the response is sent to the client.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">

SolidStart will only execute the middleware functions if the path to the middleware file is configured within `app.config.ts` using the `middleware` option.
This file must export the configuration using `export default`.

</Callout>

Learn more about middleware in the [Middleware documentation](/solid-start/advanced/middleware).

## Parameters

`createMiddleware` takes an object with the following keys:

- `onRequest` (optional): A middleware function or an array of functions to execute at the `onRequest` event.
  If an array is provided, the middleware functions will be executed one by one, in the order they appear in the array.
- `onBeforeResponse` (optional): A middleware function or an array of functions to execute at the `onBeforeResponse` event.
  If an array is provided, the middleware functions will be executed one by one, in the order they appear in the array.

## Example

```ts title="src/middleware/index.ts"

	onRequest: (event) => {
		console.log("Request received:", event.request.url);
	},
	onBeforeResponse: (event) => {

	},
