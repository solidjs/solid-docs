`entry-client.tsx` is where an application starts in the browser. 
It does this by passing [`<StartClient>`](/solid-start/reference/client/start-client) and a DOM Element (the mounting point), to the [`mount`](/solid-start/reference/client/mount) function.

```tsx
import { mount, StartClient } from "@solidjs/start/client";

mount(() => <StartClient />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

This file is an ideal place to run any client specific code that is needed on startup, such as registering service workers. 
This is the important if you are performing client-only rendering or using other modes of server-side rendering.
