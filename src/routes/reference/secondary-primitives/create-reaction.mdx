```ts
import { createReaction } from "solid-js";

function createReaction(onInvalidate: () => void): (fn: () => void) => void;
```

Sometimes it is useful to separate tracking from re-execution.
This primitive registers a side effect that is run the first time the expression wrapped by the returned tracking function is notified of a change.

```ts
const [s, set] = createSignal("start");

const track = createReaction(() => console.log("something"));

// run the reaction next time `s` changes.
track(() => s());

set("end"); // "something"

set("final"); // no-op since the reaction only runs on the first update, need to call `track` again.
```
