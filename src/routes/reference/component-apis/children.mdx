```tsx
function children(fn: () => JSX.Element): () => ResolvedChildren

```

The children's helper is used for more complex interactions with props. 
When you're not just passing children to another component using props.children once in JSX, you should use children. 
Props are normally passed in via a getter for props.children in this manner:

```tsx
const resolved = children(() => props.children)
```

The return value is a [memo](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-memo) evaluating to the resolved children, which updates whenever the children change. 
Using this memo instead of accessing `props.children` directly has some important advantages in some scenarios. 
The underlying issue is that, when you specify component children via JSX, Solid automatically defines `props.children` as a property getter, so that the children are created (in particular, DOM is created) whenever `props.children` gets accessed. 

Two particular consequences:

1. If you access `props.children` multiple times, the children (and associated DOM) get created multiple times. 
This is useful if you want the DOM to be duplicated (as DOM nodes can appear in only one parent element), but in many cases it creates redundant DOM nodes. 
If you instead call `resolved()` multiple times, you re-use the same children.

2. If you access `props.children` outside of a tracking scope (e.g., in an event handler), then you create children that will never be cleaned up. 
If you instead call `resolved()`, you re-use the already resolved children. 
You also guarantee that the children are tracked in the current component, as opposed to another tracking scope such as another component.

In addition, the `children` helper "resolves" children by calling argumentless functions and flattening arrays of arrays into an array. 
For example, a child specified with JSX like `{signal() * 2}` gets wrapped into a getter function `() => count() * 2` in `props.children`, but gets evaluated to an actual number in resolved, properly depending on a count signal.

If the given `props.children` is not an array (which occurs when the JSX tag has a single child), then the `children` helper will not normalize it into an array. 
This is useful behavior e.g. when the intention is to pass a single function as a child, which can be detected via `typeof resolved() === 'function'`. 
If you want to normalize to an array, the returned memo has a `toArray` method _(new in 1.5)_.

In most cases, you don't need (and in some cases, don't want) to use the `children` helper if you're just passing `props.children` on to another component or element via JSX:

```tsx
const Wrapper = (props) => {
	return <div>{props.children}</div>
}
```

An important aspect of the `children` helper is that it forces the children to be created and resolved, as it accesses `props.children` immediately. 
This can be undesirable for conditional rendering, e.g., when using the children within a [`<Show>`](/reference/components/show) component. 
For example, the following code always evaluates the children:

```tsx
const resolved = children(() => props.children)

return <Show when={visible()}>{resolved()}</Show>
```

To evaluate the children only when `<Show>` would render them, you can push the call to children inside a component or a function within `<Show>`, which only evaluates its children when the when condition is true. 
Another nice workaround is to pass `props.children` to the children helper only when you actually want to evaluate the children:

```tsx
const resolved = children(() => visible() && props.children)
```
