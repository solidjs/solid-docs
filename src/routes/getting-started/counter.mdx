1. Open your newly scaffolded project in your code editor of choice.
2. Create a new file called `Counter.jsx` in the `src/components` directory.
3. In `Counter.tsx`, use Solid's `createSignal` to create a reactive counter state.
4. Export the `Counter` component and import it into your main application file (e.g., `src/App.jsx`).
5. Use the `Counter` component in your application and test its functionality.
