`modifyMutable` streamlines the process of making multiple changes to a mutable Store, as obtained through the use of [`createMutable`](/reference/store-utilities/create-mutable).

It operates within a single [`batch`](/reference/reactive-utilities/batch), ensuring that dependent computations are updated just once, rather than triggering updates for each individual change.

```tsx
import { modifyMutable } from "solid-js/store"

function modifyMutable<T>(mutable: T, modifier: (state: T) => T): void
```

The function takes two arguments:

1. The first argument is the mutable Store that needs modification.
2. The second argument is a Store modifier, which could be one of those returned by [`reconcile`](/reference/store-utilities/reconcile).

:::caution
	When passing in your own modifier function, it's important to be aware that
	its argument is an unwrapped version of the store.
:::

For example, if the UI depends on multiple fields of a mutable:

```tsx
import { createMutable } from "solid-js/store"

const state = createMutable({
	user: {
		firstName: "John",
		lastName: "Smith",
	},
});

<h1>Hello {state.user.firstName + " " + state.user.lastName}</h1>;
```

Modifying n fields in sequence will cause the UI to update n times:

```tsx
state.user.firstName = "Jane";
state.user.lastName = "Doe";
```

To trigger just a single update, the fields can be modified using a `batch`:

```tsx
import { batch } from "solid-js"

batch(() => {
	state.user.firstName = "Jane";
	state.user.lastName = "Doe";
});
```

`modifyMutable` combined with [`reconcile`](/reference/store-utilities/reconcile) or [`produce`](/reference/store-utilities/produce) provides two alternate ways to do similar things:

```tsx
import { modifyMutable, reconcile } from "solid-js/store"

// Replace state.user with the specified object (deleting any other fields)
modifyMutable(
	state.user,
	reconcile({
		firstName: "Jane",
		lastName: "Doe",
	})
);
```

```tsx
import { modifyMutable, produce } from "solid-js/store"

// Modify two fields in a batch, triggering just one update
modifyMutable(
	state,
	produce((state) => {
		state.user.firstName = "Jane";
		state.user.lastName = "Doe";
	})
);
```
