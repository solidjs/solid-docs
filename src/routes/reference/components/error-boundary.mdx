title: <ErrorBoundary>
order: 5
---

The `<ErrorBoundary>` component catches errors that occur during the rendering or updating of its children and shows a fallback UI instead.
This includes:

- Errors that occur while rendering JSX.
- Errors that occur within `createEffect`, `createMemo`, and other state management primitives.
- Errors that occur within `createResource` and other asynchronous state management or data-fetching primitives.

However, errors occurring outside the rendering process are **not** captured by error boundaries.
For instance:

- Errors that occur inside event handlers.
- Errors that occur after a `setTimeout`.

## Props

### `fallback`

**Type**: `JSX.Element | ((err: any, reset: () => void) => JSX.Element)`

`fallback` provides content to display when an error occurs.
If a function is passed, it receives two parameters:

- `err`: The caught error object.
- `reset`: A function that forces the `<ErrorBoundary>` to re-render its children and clear the error state.

If there's an error within the `fallback` itself, however, it is not caught by the same `<ErrorBoundary>`.
Instead, it will bubble up to any parent error boundaries.

## Example

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary } from "solid-js";
import { ErrorProne } from "./components";

function Example() {
	return (
		<ErrorBoundary
			fallback={(error, reset) => (
				<div>
					<p>{error.message}</p>
					<button onClick={reset}>Try Again</button>
				</div>
			)}
		>
			<ErrorProne />
		</ErrorBoundary>
	);
}
```
