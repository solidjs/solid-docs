`onCleanup` registers a cleanup method that executes on disposal or recalculation of the current reactive scopes.
Can be used in any Component or Effect to clean up any side effects that could be left behind when the component is removed from the page.

```ts
function onCleanup(fn: () => void): void

```

Without the `onCleanup` function, the event listener would remain attached to the document even after the component is removed from the page.
This can cause memory leaks and other issues.

```tsx
import { createSignal, onCleanup } from "solid-js"

const Component = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)

	const handleClick = () => setCount(count() + 1)

	// Register a cleanup method to remove the event listener when the component is removed from the page.
	onCleanup(() => {
		document.removeEventListener("click", handleClick)
	})

	return <button onClick={handleClick}>Clicked {count()} times</button>
}
```
