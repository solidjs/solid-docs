The `createEffect` primitive creates a reactive computation.
It automatically tracks reactive values, such as signals, that are accessed within the provided function.
This function re-runs whenever any of its dependencies change.

## Execution Timing

- The initial run of an effect is scheduled to run after the current rendering phase completes.
  This means it runs after all synchronous code in a component has been executed and the DOM elements have been created, but before the browser paints them to the screen.
  As a result, [refs](/concepts/refs) are set before an effect runs for the first time.
- If multiple dependencies are updated within the same batch, the effect only runs once.
- Effects always run after any pure computations (like [memos](/concepts/derived-values/memos)) in the same update cycle.
- The order in which effects run is not guaranteed.
- Effects are not run during Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or the initial client hydration.

## Import

```ts
import { createEffect } from "solid-js";
```

## Type

```ts
function createEffect<Next>(
	fn: EffectFunction<undefined | NoInfer<Next>, Next>
): void;
function createEffect<Next, Init = Next>(
	fn: EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>,
	value: Init,
	options?: { name?: string }
): void;
function createEffect<Next, Init>(
	fn: EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>,
	value?: Init,
	options?: { name?: string }
): void;
```

## Parameters

### `fn`

- **Type:** `EffectFunction<undefined | NoInfer<Next> | EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>`
- **Required:** Yes

The function to run.
It receives the value returned from the previous run, or the initial `value` on the first run.
The value it returns is passed to the next run.

### `value`

- **Type:** `Init`
- **Required:** No

The initial value passed to `fn` on its first run.

### `options`

- **Type:** `{ name?: string }`
- **Required:** No

An optional configuration object with the following properties:

#### `name`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** No

A name for the effect, used for identification in debugging tools like [Solid Debugger](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools).

## Return value

`createEffect` does not return a value.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

	// Every time count changes this effect re-runs.
	createEffect(() => {
		console.log("Count incremented! New value: ", count());
	});

	return (
		<div>
			<p>Count: {count()}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

### Execution Timing

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect, createRenderEffect } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

	// This is part of the component's synchronous execution.
	console.log("Hello from counter");

	// This effect is scheduled to run after the initial render is complete.
	createEffect(() => {
		console.log("Effect:", count());
	});

	// By contrast, a render effect runs synchronously during the render phase.
	createRenderEffect(() => {
		console.log("Render effect:", count());
	});

	// Setting a signal during the render phase re-runs render effects, but not effects, which are
	// still scheduled.
	setCount(1);

	// A microtask is scheduled to run after the current synchronous code (the render phase) finishes.
	queueMicrotask(() => {
		// Now that rendering is complete, signal updates will trigger effects immediately.
		setCount(2);
	});
}

// Output:
// Hello from counter
// Render effect: 0
// Render effect: 1
// Effect: 1
// Render effect: 2
// Effect: 2
```
