Effects are reactive functions that run when the values they depend on change.
They’re the main way to manage side effects that occur outside an application's scope, such as:
- DOM manipulation
- Data fetching
- Subscriptions

## What are Effects?

An effect is a reactive function that **runs automatically whenever the values it depends on change**.

Unlike [signals](/basics/signals) (which store state) or [memos](/basics/derived-state) (which derive state), effects connect your reactive data to the outside world.
They are used for running code that has side effects, meaning it interacts with or modifies something beyond Solid's reactive graph, such as:

- updating or interacting with the DOM
- logging values
- fetching or subscribing to external data
- setting up or cleaning up resources

Effects run **once when created** to establish its subscriptions, then **again whenever its dependencies change**.

## Creating an Effect

You create an effect using the `createEffect` function.
It takes a **callback function** as its first argument, which contains the code you want to run reactively.

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  createEffect(() => {
    console.log(`Count is: ${count()}`);
  });

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>
      Increment
    </button>
  );
}
```

In this example, the effect logs the current value of `count` to the console.
The effect runs once when created, logging `Count is: 0`, and will run again whenever `count` changes, in this case when the button is clicked.

## Lifecycle of an Effect

An effect goes through a predictable cycle every time it's created and re-runs:

### 1. **Initialization**

When you call `createEffect`, the effect is immediately scheduled to run **once**.
This first run happens **after the current render phase** finishes, or after the component function returns its JSX.
This ensures that the DOM is already created and refs are assigned, allowing you to safely interact with the DOM.

```tsx
createEffect(() => console.log("Initial run"));
console.log("Hello");

// Output:
// Hello
// Initial run
```

### 2. **Dependency tracking**

During its first run, the effect records every reactive value it accesses (such as signals or memos).
It becomes subscribed to those values, which are now its **dependencies**.
From then on, the effect automatically re‑runs whenever any of its dependencies change.

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

createEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Count: ${count()}`);
});

// Count: 0 runs immediately
// every setCount(...) re‑runs the effect
```

### 3. **Reactive Updates**

Whenever *any* dependency changes, the effects is scheduled to run again.
This happens **after the current synchronous code completes**, ensuring that all changes are batched together.
This means that if the dependencies change multiple times in quick succession, the effect will only run *once* after all changes are made:

```tsx
const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
const [name, setName] = createSignal("Solid");

createEffect(() => {
    console.log(`Count: ${count()}, Name: ${name()}`);
});

setCount(1);
setName("SolidJS"); 
```

In this example, the effect will only log `Count: 1, Name: SolidJS` once, after all changes have been made.

### Lifecycle functions

Effects are reactive and run whenever their dependencies change, but sometimes finer control is needed.
Solid provides lifecycle functions to manage when code runs and how it gets cleaned up.

These functions are especially useful for:
- Running a side effect **only once** when the component mounts
- Cleaning up resources, event listeners, or other side effects when the component unmounts

#### `onMount`

The [`onMount`](TODO) function allows you to run code **once** when the component is first added to the DOM.
Unlike effects, `onMount` does **not track dependencies**.
It will execute the callback once, and never again.

```tsx
import { onMount, createSignal, createEffect } from "solid-js";

function Component() {
  const [data, setData] = createSignal(null);

  createEffect(() => {
    // Still runs reactively whenever `data` changes
    console.log("Data:", data());
  });

  onMount(async () => {
    // Runs only once when the component is mounted
    const res = await fetch("/api/data");
    setData(await res.json());
  });

  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

#### `onCleanup`

Use [`onCleanup`](TODO) to **dispose of resources** before a component unmounts, or before an effect re-runs.
This will prevent memory leaks and ensure that any subscriptions or event listeners are properly removed.

```tsx
import { createSignal, onCleanup } from "solid-js";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  const timer = setInterval(() => setCount(c => c + 1), 1000);

  onCleanup(() => {
    // Runs when the component unmounts
    clearInterval(timer);
  });

  return <div>Count: {count()}</div>;
}
```
