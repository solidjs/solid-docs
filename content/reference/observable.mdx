<Title>observable</Title>

```ts
function observable<T>(input: () => T): Observable<T>;
```

This method takes a signal and produces an Observable. You can consume it from another Observable library of your choice, typically with the `from` operator.

```ts 
// How to integrate rxjs with a Solid signal
import { observable } from "solid-js";
import { from } from "rxjs";

const [s, set] = createSignal(0);

const obsv$ = from(observable(s));

obsv$.subscribe((v) => console.log(v));
```

You can also use `from` without rxjs; check out this [page](/references/api-reference/reactive-utilities/from).
