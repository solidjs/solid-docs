The fastest way to try Solid is to create a new project and run it locally.
In just a few minutes, youâ€™ll have a working Solid app running in your browser.

## Solid in your Browser

If you're looking to experiment with Solid without setting up a local environment, open the [Solid Playground](https://playground.solidjs.com/) in your browser.

If you prefer a more complete development setup, you can use the StackBlitz [Javascript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/js) or [TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts) templates.

## Create a New Project

:::note[Before You Begin]
Make sure you have a recent version of your prefer JavaScript runtime installed, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), or [Deno](https://deno.com/).
