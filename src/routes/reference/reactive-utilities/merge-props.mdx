  Learn how to merge reactive props in SolidJS for setting component defaults,
  cloning props objects, and combining multiple prop sources dynamically.
---

```ts
import { mergeProps } from "solid-js"

function mergeProps(...sources: any): any

```

A reactive object **merge** method. 
Useful for setting default props for components in case caller doesn't provide them. 
Or cloning the props object including reactive properties.

This method works by using a proxy and resolving properties in reverse order. 
This allows for dynamic tracking of properties that aren't present when the prop object is first merged.

```ts
// default props
props = mergeProps({ name: "Smith" }, props)

// clone props
newProps = mergeProps(props)

// merge props
props = mergeProps(props, otherProps)
```
