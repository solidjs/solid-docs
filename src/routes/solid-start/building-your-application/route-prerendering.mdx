title: "Route pre-rendering"
---

SolidStart offers a way to pre-render pages at build time. The easiest way to accomplish this is by passing a list of routes to be pre-rendered to the `routes` option.

```js { 6 }
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
	server: {
		prerender: {
			routes: ["/", "/about"],
		},
	},
});
```

When you wish for all your routes to be pre-rendered, you can pass `true` to the `crawlLinks` option:

```js { 6 }
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
	server: {
		prerender: {
			crawlLinks: true,
		},
	},
});
```
