  Manage complex application state with createStore. Handle nested objects,
  arrays, and derived values with fine-grained reactivity.
---

Stores were intentionally designed to manage data structures like objects and arrays but are capable of handling other data types, such as strings and numbers.

## Types Signature

```tsx
import { createStore } from "solid-js/store"
import type { StoreNode, Store, SetStoreFunction } from "solid-js/store"

function createStore<T extends StoreNode>(
	state: T | Store<T>
): [get: Store<T>, set: SetStoreFunction<T>];

type Store<T> = T; // conceptually readonly, but not typed as such
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { createStore } from "solid-js/store";

// Initialize store
const [store, setStore] = createStore({
	userCount: 3,
	users: [
		{
			id: 0,
			username: "felix909",
			location: "England",
			loggedIn: false,
		},
		{
			id: 1,
			username: "tracy634",
			location: "Canada",
			loggedIn: true,
		},
		{
			id: 1,
			username: "johny123",
			location: "India",
			loggedIn: true,
		},
	],
});
```

## Getter

Store objects support the use of getters to store derived values.

```tsx
const [state, setState] = createStore({
	user: {
		firstName: "John",
		lastName: "Smith",
		get fullName() {
			return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
		},
	},
});
```

## Setter

Changes can take the form of function that passes previous state and returns new state or a value.
Objects are always shallowly merged. Set values to undefined to delete them from the Store.
In TypeScript, you can delete a value by using a non-null assertion, like `undefined!`.

```tsx
const [state, setState] = createStore({
	firstName: "John",
	lastName: "Miller",
});

setState({ firstName: "Johnny", middleName: "Lee" });
// ({ firstName: 'Johnny', middleName: 'Lee', lastName: 'Miller' })

setState((state) => ({ preferredName: state.firstName, lastName: "Milner" }));
// ({ firstName: 'Johnny', preferredName: 'Johnny', middleName: 'Lee', lastName: 'Milner' })
```
