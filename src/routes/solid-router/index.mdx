Solid Router is the universal router for SolidJS which works for rendering on the client or the server.
It was inspired by and combines paradigms of [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and the [Ember Router](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/).

It supports all of Solid's SSR methods and has Solid's transitions baked in, so use it freely with suspense, resources, and lazy components. Solid Router also allows you to define a load function that loads parallel to the routes ([render-as-you-fetch](https://epicreact.dev/render-as-you-fetch/)).
