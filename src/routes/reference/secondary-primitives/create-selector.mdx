title: createSelector
---

```ts
import { createSelector } from "solid-js"

function createSelector<T, U>(
	source: () => T,
	fn?: (a: U, b: T) => boolean
): (key: U) => boolean
```

Creates a parameterized derived boolean signal `selector(key)` that indicates
whether `key` is equal to the current value of the `source` signal.
These signals are optimized to notify each subscriber only when their `key`
starts or stops matching the reactive `source` value
(instead of every time `key` changes).
If you have *n* different subscribers with different keys,
and the `source` value changes from `a` to `b`, then
instead of all *n* subscribers updating,
at most two subscribers will update:
the signal with key `a` will change to `false`,
and the signal with key `b` will change to `true`.
Thus it reduces from *n* updates to 2 updates.

Useful for defining the selection state of several selectable elements.
For example:

```tsx
const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = createSignal()
const isSelected = createSelector(selectedId)

<For each={list()}>
	{(item) => <li classList={{ active: isSelected(item.id) }}>{item.name}</li>}
</For>
```

In the code above, each `li` element receives an `active` class
exactly when the corresponding `item.id` is equal to `selectedId()`.
When the `selectedId` signal changes, the `li` element(s) that previously
had previously matching `id` get the `active` class removed, and the 
`li` element(s) that now have a matching `id` get the `active` class added.
All other `li` elements get skipped, so if `id`s are distinct,
only 2 DOM operations get performed.

By contrast, the following code would perform `list().length` DOM operations
every time the `selectedId` signal changes:

```tsx
const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = createSignal()

<For each={list()}>
	{(item) => <li classList={{ active: selectedId() === item.id }}>{item.name}</li>}
</For>
```

## Arguments

| Name     | Type                      | Description                                  |
| :------- | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| `source` | `() => T`                 | The source signal to get the value from and compare with keys. |
| `fn`     | `(a: U, b: T) => boolean` | A function to compare the key and the value, returning whether they should be treated as equal. Default: `===` |
