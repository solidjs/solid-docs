[Zerops](https://zerops.io) is a dev-first cloud platform that can be used to deploy both Static and SSR Solid Node.js Apps.

For additional one-to-one support, details, and features, you can join the [Zerops Discord server](https://discord.gg/xxzmJSDKPT) and [visit the Zerops Docs](https://docs.zerops.io).

## Setting up an Account on Zerops

1. Go to [Zerops Registration](https://app.zerops.io/registration) and sign up using GitHub, GitLab, or just your email.

## Setting up your Project Infrastructure

There are two ways to set up a Zerops project and a service:

#### Using Project Add Wizard (GUI)

1. Go to your [Zerops dashboard](https://app.zerops.io/dashboard/projects).
2. Add a new project using your sidebar. If you're in compact mode, click on your profile and then "Add new project."
3. You'll be redirected to a page where you can choose a service.

##### For Static:
1. Choose Static.
2. Scroll down and change the hostname to your preference.
3. Scroll down and click on the "Add New Static" button.

##### For SSR - Node.js:
1. Choose `Node.js` and select `version 20`.
2. Scroll down and change the hostname to your preference.
3. Scroll down and click on the "Add New Node.js" button.

#### Using Project Import YAML

**Note**: This is only used for project creation using YAML on the web interface—no need to add it to the project.

1. Go to your [Zerops dashboard](https://app.zerops.io/dashboard/projects) and click on your profile icon if you are a new user. If not, check your sidebar and click on `Import Project`.

##### Static:
```yaml
project:
  name: recipe-solidjs

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: static
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
```

##### SSR - Node.js:
```yaml
project:
  name: recipe-solidjs

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: nodejs@20
    enableSubdomainAccess: true
```

## Add zerops.yml to your repository
The `zerops.yml` configuration file is used to tell Zerops how to build and run your application, it should be placed to the root of your appplication's repository.

Example for **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** Apps:

Set up the `zerops.yml` file in the root of your SSR project. Make sure the setup parameter's value is the same as the hostname of the service.

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - pnpm i
        - pnpm build
      deployFiles:
        - .output
        - node_modules
        - public
        - package.json
    run:
      base: nodejs@20
      ports:
        - port: 3000
          httpSupport: true
      start: pnpm start
```

Example for **SSG (Static Site Generation)** Apps:

Set up the `zerops.yml` file in the root of your SSG project. Make sure the setup parameter's value is the same as the hostname of the service.

```yaml
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - pnpm i
        - pnpm build
      deployFiles:
        - dist/~
    run:
      base: static
```
Push the changes to your GitHub/GitLab repository (necessary if you are planning to use GitHub/GitLab).

## Deploying your apps

### Triggering the pipeline automatically by connecting Github/Gitlab repository
You can push your project by [Triggering the pipeline using Zerops CLI](#triggering-the-pipeline-using-githubgitlab) or by connecting the app service with your [GitHub](https://docs.zerops.io/references/github-integration/) / [GitLab](https://docs.zerops.io/references/gitlab-integration) repository from inside the service detail.



### Triggering the pipeline manually using Zerops CLI

To download the zCLI binary directly, use [zCLI/releases](https://github.com/zeropsio/zcli/releases) or:
1. Install the Zerops CLI using Terminal.
```bash
npm i -g @zerops/zcli
```
2. Open Settings > [Access Token Management](https://app.zerops.io/settings/token-management) in the Zerops app and generate a new access token.
3. Log in using your access token with the following command:
```bash
zcli login <token>
```
4. Navigate to the root of your app (where zerops.yml is located) and run the following command in Terminal to trigger the deploy:
```bash
zcli push
```

Feel free to check out the [Zerops Docs](http://docs.zerops.io/) and if you're confused by this guide.
