title: Nested routes
---

Nested routes are a way to create a hierarchy of routes in your application.
This is useful for creating a layout that is consistent across multiple pages, or for creating a relationship between pages that are related to each other.

In Solid Router, the following two route definitions have the same result:

```jsx
<Route path="/users/:id" component={User} />

// is the same as

<Route path="/users">
	<Route path="/:id" component={User} />
</Route>
```

The `<User />` component will render when the URL is `/users/:id` in both cases.
The difference is that in the first case, `/users/:id` is the only route, and in the second case, `/users/` is also a route.

Leaf nodes, or innermost `Route` components, are the only ones that become their own route.
If a parent `Route` component needs to be its own route, it must be specified separately:

```jsx
// This won't work the way you'd expect
<Route path="/users" component={Users}>
  <Route path="/:id" component={User} />
</Route>

// This works
<Route path="/users" component={Users} />
<Route path="/users/:id" component={User} />

// This also works
<Route path="/users">
  <Route path="/" component={Users} />
  <Route path="/:id" component={User} />
</Route>
```

## Nesting through `props.children`

Nesting can be done through the use of `props.children` passed to the route component.
This is useful for creating a layout that is consistent across multiple pages, or for creating a relationship between pages that are related to each other:

```jsx
function PageWrapper(props) {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1> We love our users! </h1>
			{props.children}
			<A href="/">Back Home</A>
		</div>
	);
}

<Route path="/users" component={PageWrapper}>
	<Route path="/" component={Users} />
	<Route path="/:id" component={User} />
</Route>
```

While the routes are still configured the same, the route elements will appear inside the parent element where the `props.children` was declared.

While routes can be nested indefinitely, it is important to note that only leaf nodes will become their own routes.

For example, this means that if you have a route that is nested 3 levels deep, only the innermost route will become its own route. 
The only route created is `/layer1/layer2`, and it appears as three nested divs.

```jsx
<Route
	path="/"
	component={(props) => <div>Onion starts here {props.children}</div>}
>
	<Route
		path="layer1"
		component={(props) => <div>Another layer {props.children}</div>}
	>
		<Route path="layer2" component={() => <div>Innermost layer</div>}>
			{" "}
		</Route>
	</Route>
</Route>
```
</Callout>
