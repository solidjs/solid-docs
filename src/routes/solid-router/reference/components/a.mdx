title: A
---

Solid Router exposes the `<A />` component as a wrapper around the [native anchor tag ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a).
It relies on the routing context provided by the [`<Router>` component](/solid-router/reference/components/router) and if used outside, will triggers a runtime error..

`<A />` supports relative and base paths. `<a />` doesn't. But `<a />` gets augmented
when JS is present via a top-level listener to the DOM, so you get the
soft-navigation experience nonetheless.

The `<A />` supports the [`<Router />`](/solid-router/reference/components/router) base property (`<Router base="/subpath">`) and prepend it to the received `href` automatically and the `<a />`does not.
The same happens with relative paths passed to `<A />`.

The `<A>` tag has an `active` class if its href matches the current location, and `inactive` otherwise.
By default matching includes locations that are descendants (e.g.: href `/users` matches locations `/users` and `/users/123`).

:::tip
Use the boolean `end` prop to prevent matching these. This is particularly
useful for links to the root route `/` which would match everything.

## Soft Navigation

When JavaScript is present at the runtime, both components behave in a very similar fashion.
This is because Solid Router adds a listener at the top level of the DOM and will augment the native `<a />` tag to a more performant experience (with soft navigation).

:::info

To prevent, both `<A />` and `<a />` tags from soft navigating when JavaScript is present, pass a `target="_self"` attribute.

## Props Reference

| prop          | type    | description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| href          | string  | The path of the route to navigate to. This will be resolved relative to the route that the link is in, but you can preface it with `/` to refer back to the root.                        |
| noScroll      | boolean | If true, turn off the default behavior of scrolling to the top of the new page                                                                                                           |
| replace       | boolean | If true, don't add a new entry to the browser history. (By default, the new page will be added to the browser history, so pressing the back button will take you to the previous route.) |
| state         | unknown | [Push this value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) to the history stack when navigating                                                               |
| inactiveClass | string  | The class to show when the link is inactive (when the current location doesn't match the link)                                                                                           |
| activeClass   | string  | The class to show when the link is active                                                                                                                                                |
| end           | boolean | If `true`, only considers the link to be active when the current location matches the `href` exactly; if `false`, check if the current location _starts with_ `href`                     |
