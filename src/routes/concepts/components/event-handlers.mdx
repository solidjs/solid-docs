title: Event Handlers
order: 3

Event handlers are functions that are called in response to specific events
occurring in the browser, such as when a user clicks or taps on an element.

Solid provides two ways to add event listeners to the browser. Using the `on:__`
form, which will add an event listener to the element, commonly known as a
`Native Event`. Using the `on__` form which will add an event listener to the
document and dispatch it to the element, commonly known as a `Delegated Event`.
The reason for the two forms is performance, delegated events could save some
resources and perform better on commonly used events.

To add an event handler, you can use any of the `on` or `on:` forms as a prefix
followed by the event name, and assign it a function. The function will be
called whenever the event is dispatched.

```tsx
// delegated event
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>

// native event
<div on:scroll={handleScroll}>... very long text ...</div>
```

Delegated events are case-insensitive, while Native events are case-sensitive.
When using delegated event handlers in Solid, they can be written using
camelCase or all lowercase.

```tsx
<button onclick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

<Callout type="tip" title="Event handlers are not reactive.">

Attaching and detaching listeners on elements is a costly process. To prevent
performance degradation, event handlers are not reactive. Since event handlers
are called like regular functions upon each event trigger, there's no inherent
need for them to be reactive.

If necessary, you can write your handlers to call a reactive source. In the
following example, handleClick represents a prop that could dynamically change
its value to any function you wish.

```tsx
<div onClick={() => props.handleClick?.()} />
```

</Callout>

## Event delegation

Instead of attaching event listeners to every individual element, Solid uses
synthetic event delegation. This means that event listeners are attached to the
document element, and events are dispatched to the relevant elements as they
bubble up.

By keeping the number of event listeners to a minimum, events can be captured
more effectively. This is especially useful when working with large lists of
elements, such as in a table or list.

Supported events such as `click`, `mouseover`, and `keydown` are just a few
examples that are optimized in this way. To view the full list see the
[references below](#delegated-events).

If you need to attach an event listener to an element that is not supported by
Solid's event delegation, you can use the
[on:](/reference/jsx-attributes/on-and-oncapture) form.

```tsx
<div on:customEvent={handleCustomEvent} />
```

<Callout type="caution">
  While delegated events provide some performance enhancements, it comes with tradeoffs:

1. Delegated events are not removed on tracking scope disposal. This may or may
   not be desired depending on the situation.
2. `event.preventDefault()` won't work as expected as the event is attached to
   the `document` instead of to the `element`. When in need to `preventDefault`
   use a Native Event instead.
   </Callout>

## Binding events

In Solid, event handlers can be bound by passing an array as the event handler.
The second item of the array is supplied as the handler's first argument.

```tsx
const handler = (data, event) => {
  console.log("Data:", data, "Event:", event);
};

<button onClick={[handler, "Hello!"]}>Click Me</button>;
```

In this example, the string `'Hello!'` (the second item in the array) is passed
as the data parameter (the first argument of the handler function) when the
button is clicked.

By binding events in this way, the overhead of using JavaScript's
[bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)
method and an aditional closure is avoided.
