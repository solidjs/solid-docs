title: useBeforeLeave
---

`useBeforeLeave` takes a function that will be called prior to leaving a route.
The function will be called with:

- from (_Location_): current location (before change).
- to (_string | number_}: path passed to `navigate.`
- options (_NavigateOptions_}: options passed to `navigate.`
- preventDefault (_void function_): call to block the route change.
- defaultPrevented (_readonly boolean_): `true` if any previously called leave handlers called `preventDefault()`.
- retry (_void function_, _force?: boolean_ ): call to retry the same navigation.
  Pass `true` to skip running the leave handlers again (ie. force navigate without confirming).

Example usage:

```js
useBeforeLeave((e: BeforeLeaveEventArgs) => {
	if (form.isDirty && !e.defaultPrevented) {
		// preventDefault to block immediately and prompt user async
		e.preventDefault();
		setTimeout(() => {
			if (window.confirm("Discard unsaved changes - are you sure?")) {
				// user wants to proceed anyway so retry with force=true
				e.retry(true);
			}
		}, 100);
	}
});
```
