<Title>{"<SuspenseList>"}</Title>

SuspenseList allows for coordinating multiple parallel Suspense and SuspenseList components. It controls the order in which content is revealed to reduce layout thrashing and has an option to collapse or hide fallback states.

```ts
function SuspenseList(props: {
  children: JSX.Element;
  revealOrder: "forwards" | "backwards" | "together";
  tail?: "collapsed" | "hidden";
}): JSX.Element;
```

**Note**: SuspenseList is still in the experimental stage and does not have full `SSR` support.

Here's an example of how to use SuspenseList:

```tsx
<SuspenseList revealOrder="forwards" tail="collapsed">
  <ProfileDetails user={resource.user} />
  <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading posts...</h2>}>
    <ProfileTimeline posts={resource.posts} />
  </Suspense>
  <Suspense fallback={<h2>Loading fun facts...</h2>}>
    <ProfileTrivia trivia={resource.trivia} />
  </Suspense>
</SuspenseList>
```
