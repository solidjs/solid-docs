title: createAsync
---

<Callout>
	This is light wrapper over [`createResource`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-resource)
	which serves as a stand-in for a future primitive being brought to Solid core
	in 2.0.
</Callout>

An asynchronous primitive with a function that tracks similar to `createMemo`.
`createAsync` expects a promise back that is then turned into a Signal.
Reading it before it is ready causes Suspense/Transitions to trigger.

```jsx
const user = createAsync(() => getUser(params.id));
```

<Callout>
	Using `cache` in `createResource` directly will not work since the fetcher is
	not reactive. This means that it will not invalidate properly.
</Callout>
