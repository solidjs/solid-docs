title: textContent
---

The `textContent` attribute is equivalent to the [`textContent` DOM property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent).
This attribute replaces all existing child nodes of the element with a single text node containing the provided string.

Using `textContent` can improve performance when the element's children are known to be exclusively text, as it bypasses the generic diffing process.
