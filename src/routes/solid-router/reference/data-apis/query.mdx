The `query` function wraps an asynchronous function (the fetcher) and returns a query.

The primary purpose of a query is to prevent redundant data fetching.
When a query is called, a key is generated from its name and arguments.
This key is used to internally cache the result of the fetcher.
If a query with the same key is called, the cached result is used in these scenarios:

- **For preloading:**
  After a route's data is preloaded, a subsequent call to the same query within a 5-second window uses the preloaded data.
- **For active subscriptions:**
  When a query is actively being used by a component (e.g., via [`createAsync`](/solid-router/reference/data-apis/create-async)), its data is reused without expiration.
- **On native history navigation:**
  When navigating with the browser's back or forward buttons, the data is reused instead of being re-fetched.
- **For server-side deduplication:**
  Within a single server-side rendering (SSR) request, repeated calls to the same query reuse the same value.
- **During client hydration:**
  If SSR has provided data for a key, that data is used immediately on the client without a new network request.

## Import

```tsx
import { query } from "@solidjs/router";
```

## Type

```tsx
function query<T extends (...args: any) => any>(
  fn: T,
  name: string
): CachedFunction<T>;
```

## Parameters

### `fetcher`

- **Type:** `T extends (...args: any) => any`
- **Required:** Yes

An asynchronous function that handles the logic for fetching data.
All arguments passed to this function must be JSON-serializable.

### `name`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** Yes

A string used as a namespace for the query.
Solid Router combines this with the query's arguments to generate a unique key for deduplication.

## Return value

`query` returns a new function with the same call signature as the fetcher.
This returned function has the following properties attached to it:

### `key`

The base key for the query, derived from its name.

### `keyFor`

A function that takes the same arguments as the fetcher and returns a string representing a specific key for that set of arguments.

## Example

### Basic usage

```tsx
import { query } from "@solidjs/router";

const getUserProfileQuery = query(async (userId: string) => {
	const response = await fetch(
		`https://api.example.com/users/${encodeURIComponent(userId)}`
	);
	const json = await response.json();

	if (!response.ok) {
		throw new Error(json?.message ?? "Failed to load user profile.");
	}

	return json;
}, "userProfile");
```
