`onCleanup` registers a cleanup method that executes on disposal and recalculation of the current tracking scope.
Can be used anywhere to clean up any side effects left behind by initialization.

When used in a Component, it runs when the component is unmounted.
When used in tracking scope, such [`createEffect`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-effect), [`createMemo`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-memo) or a [`createRoot`](/reference/reactive-utilities/create-root), it runs when the tracking scope is disposed or refreshed.

```ts
import { onCleanup } from "solid-js"

function onCleanup(fn: () => void): void;
```

Without the `onCleanup` function, the event listener would remain attached to the `document` even after the component is removed from the page.
This can cause memory leaks and other issues.

```tsx
import { createSignal, onCleanup } from "solid-js"

const Component = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

	const handleClick = () => setCount((value) => value + 1);

	document.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

	/**
	 * Remove the event listener when the component is removed/unmounted from the page.
	 */
	onCleanup(() => {
		document.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
	});

	return <main>Document has been clicked {count()} times</main>;
};
```
