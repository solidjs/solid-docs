title: renderToStream
---

```ts
import { renderToStream } from "solid-js/web";

function renderToStream<T>(
	fn: () => T,
	options?: {
		nonce?: string;
		renderId?: string;
		onCompleteShell?: () => void;
		onCompleteAll?: () => void;
	}
): {
	pipe: (writable: { write: (v: string) => void }) => void;
	pipeTo: (writable: WritableStream) => void;
};
```

This method renders to a stream.
It renders the content synchronously including any Suspense fallback placeholders, and then continues to stream the data and HTML from any async resource as it completes.

```ts
// node
renderToStream(App).pipe(res);

// web stream
const { readable, writable } = new TransformStream();
renderToStream(App).pipeTo(writable);
```

`onCompleteShell` fires when synchronous rendering is complete before writing the first flush to the stream out to the browser.
`onCompleteAll` is called when all server Suspense boundaries have settled.
`renderId` is used to namespace renders when having multiple top level roots.
