The `useAction` primitive returns a function that invokes a given [action](/solid-router/concepts/actions) when called.

`useAction` requires client-side JavaScript and is not progressively enhanceable.

## Parameters

- `action`:
  The action to be invoked.

## Returns

`useAction` returns a function that invokes the action.
It takes the same parameters as the action handler and returns a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves with the action's result.

## Example

```tsx
import { action, useAction } from "@solidjs/router";

const likePostAction = action(async (id: string) => {
	// ... Likes a post on the server.
});

function LikeButton(props: { postId: string }) {
	const likePost = useAction(likePostAction);

	return <button onClick={() => likePost(props.postId)}>Like</button>;
}
```
