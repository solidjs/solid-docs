## Welcome

Welcome to Solid's new docs site! These pages are the beginnings of our new effort, and we're super excited for you to join us.

Solid is a front-end framework for building web apps. It's designed to have a great developer experience, and we want the docs to match, both in terms of being beginner-friendly and showcasing the usability of the framework.

## Current documentation

The existing documentation was originally written by the framework author and edited by the community. There is an [interactive tutorial](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/introduction_basics) that explains how to use each of the framework's features - it's more like an interactive reference. We also have [guides](https://www.solidjs.com/guides/getting-started) that were originally adapted from blog posts. The [API Reference](https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api) serves as a comprehensive technical reference document.

Here are some issues we've noticed and received feedback about:

- The tutorial isn't beginner friendly; it assumes technical knowledge that many beginners don't have.
- We have a lot of information on the framework itself, but not much on how to use the framework in real-world applications.
- Our guides are informative but not easy to follow.
- It's not clear where to go when you're looking for help with something specific.
- We don't answer the question "how do I build an app from scratch?"
- Our docs are too academic/technical.

## How we're approaching new docs

Rather than editing the existing docs, we decided to make a new docs site to start fresh with structure, content, and voice. We also started a Docs Team and made it clear that docs are a [Core](https://www.solidjs.com/contributors) concern.

The new site uses a writing tool called [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/), which is an extention of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) that allows us to experiment with embedded rich components.

We wrote out [writing principles and a new structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z25C3LhJF4KGbf1YvnmQo7dOzF5KjEVQtoE0ucy3BJs/edit?usp=sharing) that follows the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) model. We want our guides to include both project-based tutorials and topic-based how-to guides, and we want our reference section to not just include API reference, but concept explanations inspired by Diataxis's "Explanation" category.

We're also exploring [video content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J70HXl1KhWE) - we see a lot of potential in video tutorials and docs companion videos.

## How to get involved

If you're here from the Write the Docs conference, we'd love your thoughts on our plan and our first steps.
This is a volunteer, open-source effort, and we're always looking for new contributors, whether it's to focus on a specific piece of content or to join the docs team!

Outside of the conference, our main point of communication is [Solid's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/solidjs). Once you're there, check out the `#docs` channel. You can also contact `@jutanium` on Discord (or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jutanium) if you haven't joined us yet!).

We're looking for anyone who cares about communication. If you've never written a line of JavaScript and are interested in what we're doing, we want to teach you. The more outside and diverse perspectives we have, the better our team will be.
