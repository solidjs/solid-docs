  Create non-tracked owner scopes in SolidJS for manual memory management.
  Essential for nested tracking scopes and preventing auto-disposal.
---

```ts
import { createRoot } from "solid-js"

function createRoot<T>(fn: (dispose: () => void) => T): T

```

Creates a new non-tracked owner scope that doesn't auto-dispose. 
This is useful for nested tracking scopes that you do not wish to release when the parent re-evaluates.

All Solid code should be wrapped in one of these top level as they ensure that all memory/computations are freed up. 
Normally you do not need to worry about this as createRoot is embedded into all render entry functions.
