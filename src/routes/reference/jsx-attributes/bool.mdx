title: bool:*
---

`bool:*` controls the presence of an attribute in an element.
When the value is `truthy` it adds the `attribute` to the element.
Alternatively, when the value is `falsy` it removes the `attribute` from the element.
This attribute is most useful for Web Components.

```tsx
<my-element bool:status={prop.value} />
```

```tsx
// Assuming `prop.value` is `truthy`, then it becomes
<my-element status />

// And when `falsy`, then it becomes
<my-element />

```
