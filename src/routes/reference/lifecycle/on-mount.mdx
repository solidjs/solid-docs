Registers a method that runs after initial rendering is done and the elements are mounted to the page.
Ideal for using [refs](/reference/jsx-attributes/ref) and managing other one-time setup.

```tsx
import { onMount } from "solid-js"

function onMount(fn: () => void): void

```

This is an alias for an effect that is non-tracking, meaning that it is equivalent to a [`createEffect`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-effect) with no dependencies.

```tsx
// example that shows how to use onMount to get a reference to an element
import { onMount } from "solid-js"

function MyComponent() {
	let ref: HTMLButtonElement

	// when the component is mounted, the button will be disabled
	onMount(() => {
		ref.disabled = true
	})
	return <button ref={ref}>Focus me!</button>
}
```
