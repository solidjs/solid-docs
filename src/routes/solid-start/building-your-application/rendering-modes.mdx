title: "Rendering Modes"
---

SolidStart has 3 kinds of rendering modes:

- `sync`: renders on server with `renderToString` and performs Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for asynchronous features.
- `async`: renders on server with `renderToStringAsync`. Blocking the response until all asynchronous data fetching is resolved.
- `stream` (default): renders on server with `renderToStream`. Streaming the response as soon as possible and continuing to fetch asynchronous data in the background, resolving the page as soon as possible and sending next chunks.

All modes have some degree of Server-Side Rendering, you may need to change them globally depending on your deployment provider.

### Sync Mode

Uses [`renderToString`](/reference/rendering/render-to-string) to render the page from Solid's core to render the page synchronously.
All async features are disabled and the page is rendered as soon as possible and sent to the client-side where data fetching will happen post-hydration.

:::caution[Page Components]
In SolidStart, all page components are lazy-loaded by default. This means that `renderToString` will SSR only until `app.tsx` and the route components will be rendered client-side.
:::

Asynchronous features will be directly impacted since rendering will mostly happen on the client-side.

- Data-fetching: client-side only, first load will render Suspense fallbacks.
- Time To First Byte (TTFB): fast since the server-side rendering is minimal.
- Total page load time: slower since the client-side rendering is heavier.

### Async Mode

Uses [`renderToStringAsync`](/reference/rendering/render-to-string-async) to render the page from Solid's core to render the page asynchronously.
Uses [`renderToStringAsync`](/reference/rendering/render-to-string-async) from Solid's core to render the page asynchronously.

:::tip[SEO and Bot Support]
No suspense fallbacks are shown in the browser, which makes this mode ideal for SEO optimizations and bot support.
:::

Asynchronous features will happen in the Server-Side during first render.

- **Data-fetching**: first render will be similar to sync mode, but data fetching will still happen in the background and responses will be streamed in chunks as available.
- **Time To First Byte (TTFB)**: slower since the server-side rendering is heavier.
- **Total page load time**: faster than sync mode since the server-side tends to be faster than the client-side.

### Stream Mode (default)

Uses [`renderToStream`](/reference/rendering/render-to-stream) to render the page from Solid's core to render the page streaming.
Leveraging [TransformableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream) to progressively send the HTML to the client-side.

:::tip[Performance and Future-Friendly Apps]
This mode is ideal for performance and future-friendly apps. It provides best perceived performance and consumes less memory and CPU from the client-side.

## Global Configuration

The modes can be defined app-wide via the configuration file or via the [`entry-server.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/entry-server) file.

```tsx title="app.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
	mode: "stream",
});
```

The value in [`entry-server.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/entry-server) overrides the value in [`app.config.ts`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/app-config).

```tsx title="src/entry-server.tsx"
import { createHandler, StartServer } from "@solidjs/start/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
	<StartServer document={...} />
), {
	mode: "async"
});
```

## Per-Route Configuration

The optional secondary parameter in [`createHandler`](/solid-start/reference/server/create-handler) can be an object or a function that receives the `RequestEvent` and returns an object with the mode to use for the route.

```tsx title="src/entry-server.tsx"
import { createHandler, StartServer } from "@solidjs/start/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
	<StartServer document={...} />
), {
	mode: (event) => {
		return { mode: event.request.url.includes("/special-route") ? "async" : "stream" };
	}
});
```

It can also be used for bot detection via the `userAgent` property of the `RequestEvent`.

```tsx title="src/entry-server.tsx"
import { createHandler, StartServer } from "@solidjs/start/server";

export default createHandler(() => (
	<StartServer document={...} />
), {
	mode: (event) => {
		return { mode: isBot(event.request.userAgent) ? "async" : "stream" };
	}
});
```
