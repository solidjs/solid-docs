title: Dynamic Routes
---

When a path is unknown ahead of time, it can be treated as a flexible parameter that is passed on to the component:

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

const Users = lazy(() => import("./pages/Users"));
const User = lazy(() => import("./pages/User"));
const Home = lazy(() => import("./pages/Home"));

render(
	() => (
		<Router>
			<Route path="/users" component={Users} />
			<Route path="/users/:id" component={User} />
			<Route path="/" component={Home} />
		</Router>
	),
	document.getElementById("app")
);
```

The colon (`:`) indicates that `id` can be any string.
Once a URL matches the pattern, the `User` component will be shown.
When using dynamic segments, the values can be accessed via the [`useParams`](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-params) hook within the component.

<Callout title="Note on Animation/Transitions">
Routes that share the same path match will be treated as the same route.
If you want to force re-render you can wrap your component in a keyed [`Show`](/concepts/control-flow/conditional-rendering) like:

```jsx
<Show when={params.something} keyed>
	<MyComponent />
</Show>
```

</Callout>

Each path parameter can be validated using a `MatchFilter`.
This allows for more complex routing descriptions rather than just checking the presence of a parameter.

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";
import type { SegmentValidators } from "./types";

const User = lazy(() => import("./pages/User"));

const filters: MatchFilters = {
	parent: ["mom", "dad"], // allow enum values
	id: /^\d+$/, // only allow numbers
	withHtmlExtension: (v: string) => v.length > 5 && v.endsWith(".html"), // we want an `*.html` extension
};

render(
	() => (
		<Router>
			<Route
				path="/users/:parent/:id/:withHtmlExtension"
				component={User}
				matchFilters={filters}
			/>
		</Router>
	),
	document.getElementById("app")
);

```

Here, `matchFilters` prop allows for validation of the `parent`, `id` and `withHtmlExtension` parameters against the filters defined in `filters`.
If the validation fails, the route will not match.

So in this example:

- `/users/mom/123/contact.html` would match,
- `/users/dad/123/about.html` would match,
- `/users/aunt/123/contact.html` would not match as `:parent` is not 'mom' or 'dad',
- `/users/mom/me/contact.html` would not match as `:id` is not a number,
- `/users/dad/123/contact` would not match as `:withHtmlExtension` is missing `.html`.

## Optional Parameters

Parameters can be specified as optional by adding a question mark to the end of the parameter name:

```jsx
// Matches stories and stories/123 but not stories/123/comments
<Route path="/stories/:id?" component={Stories} />
```

## Wildcard Routes

`:param` provides an arbitrary name at that point in the path.
Using an asterisk (`*`) will provide a way to match any end of the path:

```jsx
// Matches any path that begins with foo, including foo/, foo/a/, foo/a/b/c
<Route path="foo/*" component={Foo} />
```

If the wild part of the path to the component as a parameter needs to be exposed, it can be named:

```jsx
<Route path="foo/*any" component={Foo} />
```

**Note:** that the wildcard token must be the last part of the path; `foo/*any/bar` will not create any routes.

## Multiple Paths

Routes also support defining multiple paths using an array.
This allows a route to remain mounted and not rerender when switching between two or more locations that it matches:

```jsx
// Navigating from login to register does not cause the Login component to re-render
<Route path={["login", "register"]} component={Login} />
```
