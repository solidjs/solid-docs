The fastest way to try Solid is to create a new project and run it locally.
In just a few minutes, you’ll have a working Solid app running in your browser.

## Solid in your Browser

If you're looking to experiment with Solid without setting up a local environment, open the [Solid Playground](https://playground.solidjs.com/) in your browser.

If you prefer a more complete development setup, you can use the StackBlitz [JavaScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/js) or [TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts) templates.

## Create a New Project

:::note[Before You Begin]
Make sure you have a recent version of your preferred JavaScript runtime installed, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), or [Deno](https://deno.com/).

To create a new Solid project, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal and navigate to the directory** where you want to create your project.

2. **Run the following command:**

```package-create
solid
```

3. **Follow the CLI prompts** to select your project name, template (JavaScript or TypeScript), and other options.

```sh
◆ Project Name
|  <solid-project>

◆ Is this a SolidStart project?
|  ● Yes / ○ No

◆ Which template would you like to use?
│  ● ts
│  ○ ts-vitest
│  ○ ts-uvu
│  ○ ts-unocss
│  ○ ts-tailwindcss

◆ Use TypeScript?
│  ● Yes / ○ No
```

4. **Follow the instructions to install the dependencies and start the development server:**

```sh title="npm" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

```sh title="pnpm" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

```sh title="yarn" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
yarn install
yarn dev
```

```sh title="bun" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
bun install
bun run dev
```

```sh title="deno" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
deno install
deno run dev
```

6. **Open your browser and go to the local URL** provided in the terminal to see your new Solid app in action!
