The fastest way to try Solid is to create a new project and run it locally.
In just a few minutes, youâ€™ll have a working Solid app running in your browser.

## Browser-Based Development

To try Solid without a local setup:

- **[Solid Playground](https://playground.solidjs.com/)** - Interactive online editor with live preview
- **StackBlitz Templates** - Full IDE experience in the browser:
  - [JavaScript template](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/js)
  - [TypeScript template](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts)

## Using the Solid CLI

The recommended approach uses the official Solid project generator:

```package-create
solid
```

This command will prompt you to configure your project:

- **Project Name**: Choose a name for your project directory
- **Type of Project**: You can select from the following options:
    - `SolidStart` - Solid's full-stack framework for building web applications
    - `SolidJS + Vite` - A minimal setup using Vite as the build tool
    - `Library` - For creating a Solid-based library
- **TypeScript**: Choose whether to use TypeScript or JavaScript
- **Select a template**: Pick a starter template that fits your needs. To see a list of available templates, visit the [Solid Templates repository](https://github.com/solidjs/templates).

Once the setup is complete, the CLI will create a new directory with your project files. Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```sh title="npm" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
npm install
```

```sh title="pnpm" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
pnpm install
```

```sh title="yarn" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
yarn install
```

```sh title="bun" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
bun install
```

```sh title="deno" tab="package-manager"
cd solid-project
deno install
```

After the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```package-run
dev
```

Once the server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`) to see your Solid application in action!
