# Roteador

Solid is a modern JavaScript framework designed to build responsive and high-performing user interfaces (UI).
It prioritizes a simple and predictable development experience, making it a great choice for developers of all skill levels.

## What is Solid?

As a JavaScript framework, Solid embraces reactivity and fine-grained updates.

Reactivity, in programming, refers to an applications' ability to respond to changes in data or user interactions.

Traditionally, when a change occurs, the entire web page would need to reload to display the updated information.
In contrast, when using a fine-grained reactive system, updates are only applied to the parts of the page that need to be updated.

Solid adopts the concept of fine-grained reactivity, updating only when the data the application depends on changes.
This decreases work and can result in faster load times and a smoother user experience overall.

## Advantages of using Solid

- **Performant**: Fine-grained reactivity allows Solid to update only what has changed, resulting in faster load times and smoother performance overall.

- **Powerful**: Using less memory and processing power, Solid is capable of creating complex applications without compromising on functionality.
  This also gives developers the flexibility over how and when updates happen.

- **Pragmatic**: Rather than sticking to rigid structures or methods, Solid provides the freedom to choose the strategies and practices that work best for you.

- **Productive**: Regardless of experience level, Solid's clear and predictable API makes developers' work simpler and more efficient.

Solid aims to strike a balance between speed, efficiency, power, and flexibility, all while providing a developer-friendly environment.
This combination of features makes it a great choice to build responsive and high-performing UIs.
