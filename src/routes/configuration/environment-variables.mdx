title: Environment variables
---

Solid is built on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which offers a convenient way to handle environment variables.

## Public Environment Variables

Public variables are considered safe to expose to the client-side code. These variables are prefixed with `VITE_` and are injected into the client-side code during compilation time.

In the root directory of the project, create a file called `.env`.
This file will store environment variables in the `key = value` format.

If working with TypeScript it is possible to make such variables type-safe and enable your TypeScript Language Service Provider (LSP) to autocomplete them by creating a file called `.env.d.ts` in the root directory of the project.

```typescript
interface ImportMetaEnv {
	readonly VITE_USER_ID: string;
	readonly VITE_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
	readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}
```

<Callout>
To prevent accidental exposure of environment variables to the client, only variables prefixed with `VITE_` will be exposed.

For example:

```json
VITE_SECRET_KEY = 123hello
DB_PASSWORD = foobar
```

Only the `VITE_SECRET_KEY` will be exposed to client source code, while `DB_PASSWORD` will not, as shown below.

```jsx
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SECRET_KEY); // 123hello
console.log(import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD); // undefined
```

</Callout>
    
```jsx
function MyComponent() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>
				Component with environment variable used{" "}
				{import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME}
				the value will be replaced during compilation time.
			</h2>
		</div>
	);
}
```

## Private Environment Variables

These variables should only be accessed in your backend code, and so it's best to not use `VITE_` prefix for them. Instead, use `process.env` to access them. Depending on the [Nitro preset](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy) chosen, they'll be made available automatically or they will require an external dependency such as [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

```jsx
DB_HOST="somedb://192.110.0"
DB_PASSWORD = super_secret_password_hash
```

To access them, within your backend code, use `process.env`.
For an example, check the pseudo-code below.

```jsx
	"use server"

	const client = new DB({
		host: process.env.DB_URL,
		password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD
	});
}
```

It is also possible to make `process.env` type-safe via the same `.env.d.ts` file.

```typescript

declare namespace NodeJS {
	interface ProcessEnv {
		readonly DB_URL: string
		readonly DB_PASSWORD: string
	}
}
```
