title: useBeforeLeave
---

`useBeforeLeave` takes a function that will be called prior to leaving a route.
The function will be called with:

- from (_Location_): current location (before change)
- to (_string | number_): path passed to `navigate`
- options (_NavigateOptions_): options passed to `navigate`
- preventDefault (_void function_): call to block the route change
- defaultPrevented (_readonly boolean_): `true` if any previously called leave handlers called `preventDefault()`
- retry (_void function_, _force?: boolean_ ): call to retry the same navigation
  Pass `true` to skip running the leave handlers again (ie. force navigate without confirming)

Example usage

```js
useBeforeLeave((e: BeforeLeaveEventArgs) => {
  if (form.isDirty && !e.defaultPrevented) {
    // preventDefault to block immediately and prompt user async
    e.preventDefault();
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (window.confirm("Discard unsaved changes - are you sure?")) {
        // user wants to proceed anyway so retry with force=true
        e.retry(true);
      }
    }, 100);
  }
});
```
