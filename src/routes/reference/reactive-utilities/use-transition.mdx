  Batch async updates with transitions in SolidJS. Track pending states and
  defer commits until all async processes complete for smooth UI updates.
---

```ts
import { useTransition } from "solid-js"

function useTransition(): [
	pending: () => boolean,
	startTransition: (fn: () => void) => Promise<void>
]

```

Used to batch async updates in a transaction deferring commit until all async processes are complete. 
This is tied into Suspense and only tracks resources read under Suspense boundaries.

```ts
const [isPending, start] = useTransition();

// check if transitioning
isPending();

// wrap in transition
start(() => setSignal(newValue), () => /* transition is done */)
```
