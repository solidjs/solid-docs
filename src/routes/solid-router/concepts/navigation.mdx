title: "Navigation"

When using Solid Router, you can use the standard standard HTML [`<a>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), which triggers [soft navigation](/solid-router/reference/components/a#soft-navigation).
In addition to using this, Solid Router offers other options for navigating between routes:

- The [`<A>` component](/solid-router/reference/components/a).
- The [`useNavigate` primitive](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-navigate).
- The [`redirect` function](/solid-router/reference/response-helpers/redirect).

## `<A>` component

The `<A>` component extends the native `<a>` element by automatically applying the base URL path and, additionally, supports relative paths.

```tsx
import { A } from "@solidjs/router";

function DashboardPage() {
	return (
		<main>
			<nav>
				<A href="/">Home</a>
			</nav>
			{/* This is a relative path that, from /dashboard, links to /dashboard/users */}
			<A href="users">Users</A>
		</main>
	);
}
```

See the [`<A>` API reference](/solid-router/reference/components/a) for more information.

### Styling

The `<A>` component allows you to style links based on their active state using the `activeClass` and `inactiveClass` props.
When provided, these props apply the corresponding CSS classes to the link.
If omitted, the default classes `active` and `inactive` are used.

By default, a link is considered active when the current route matches the link's `href` or any of its descendant routes.
For example, a link with `href="/dashboard"` is active when the current route is `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/users`, or `/dashboard/users/1/profile`.

To match an exact route, the prop `end` can be used.
When `true`, it ensures that the link is only considered active if the `href` exactly matches the current route.
This is useful for root route links (href="/"), which might otherwise match all routes.

```tsx
import { A } from "@solidjs/router";

function Navbar() {
	return (
		<nav>
			<A href="/" end={true}>
				Home
			</A>
			<A
				href="/login"
				activeClass="text-blue-900"
				inactiveClass="text-blue-500"
			>
				Login
			</A>
		</nav>
	);
}
```

## `useNavigate` primitive

The `useNavigate` primitive allows for programmatically navigating to a specified route.

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "@solidjs/router";

function LoginPage() {
	const navigate = useNavigate();

	return (
		<button
			onClick={() => {
				// Login logic
				navigate("/dashboard", { replace: true });
			}}
		>
			Login
		</button>
	);
}
```

This example redirects the user to `/dashboard` after login.
By using `replace: true`, the login page is removed from the browser's history stack and replaced with the `/dashboard` route.
This prevents the user from navigating back to the login page using the back button.

See the [`useNavigate` API reference](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-navigate) for more information.

## `redirect` function

The `redirect` function returns a [`Response` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), which enables navigation to a specified route within [query](/solid-router/reference/data-apis/query) or [action](/solid-router/reference/data-apis/action).

```tsx
import { action, redirect } from "@solidjs/router";

const logout = action(async () => {
	localStorage.remove("token");
	throw redirect("/");
});
```

See the [`redirect` API reference](/solid-router/reference/response-helpers/redirect) for more information.
