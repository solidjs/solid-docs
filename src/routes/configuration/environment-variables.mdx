title: Environment Variables
---

Solid is built on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which offers a convenient way to handle environment variables.
The following steps will show how to set up environment variables in a Solid project:

1. In the root directory of the project, create a file called `.env`.
   This file will store environment variables in the `key = value` format.

<Callout>
To prevent accidental exposure of environment variables to the client, only variables prefixed with `VITE_` will be exposed.

For example:

```json
VITE_SECRET_KEY = 123hello
DB_PASSWORD = foobar
```

Only the `VITE_SECRET_KEY` will be exposed to client source code, while `DB_PASSWORD` will not, as shown below.

```jsx
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SECRET_KEY); // 123hello
console.log(import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD); // undefined
```

</Callout>
    
2. In your Solid code, Vite will allow access to your environment variables by automatically injecting the environment variables into your application on compilation time.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>
				Component with environment variable used{" "}
				{import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME}
				the value will be replaced during compilation time.
			</h2>
		</div>
	);
}
```

For more information on environment variables in Vite and enabling TypeScript intellisense for environment variables, please refer to the [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files).
