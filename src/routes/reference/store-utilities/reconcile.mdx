title: reconcile
---

```tsx
function reconcile<T>(
	value: T | Store<T>,
	options?: {
		key?: string | null;
		merge?: boolean;
	} = { key: "id" }
): (
	state: T extends NotWrappable ? T : Store<T>
) => T extends NotWrappable ? T : Store<T>;
```

Diffs data changes when we can't apply granular updates.
Useful for when dealing with immutable data from stores or large API responses.

The key option is used when available to match items.
By default the `merge` option false does referential checks where possible to determine equality and replaces where items are not referentially equal.
`merge` as `true` pushes all diffing to the leaves and effectively morphs the previous data to the new value.

```ts
// subscribing to an observable
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(({ todos }) => (
  setState('todos', reconcile(todos)));
);
onCleanup(() => unsubscribe());

```

##### Options

| Option | Type    | Default | Description                        |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| key    | string  | "id"    |  Specifies the key to be used for matching items during reconciliation |
| merge  | boolean | false   | When merge is false, referential checks are performed where possible to determine equality, and items that are not referentially equal are replaced. When merge is true, all diffing is pushed to the leaves, effectively morphing the previous data to the new value. |
