title: Catch-all routes
---

Catch-all routes are used to match any URL that does not match any other route in the application. 
This is useful for displaying a 404 page or redirecting to a specific route when a user enters an invalid URL.

To create a catch-all route, place a route with a asteriks `*` as the path at the end of the route list.
Optionally, you can name the parameter to access the unmatched part of the URL.

```jsx
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";
import NotFound from "./NotFound";

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
    <Route path="*404" element={<NotFound />} />
  </Router>
);
```

Now, if a user navigates to a URL that does not match `/home` or `/about`, the `NotFound` component will be rendered.
