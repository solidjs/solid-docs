  Prevent client-side hydration for static content in SolidJS. Optimize
  performance by skipping hydration for server-rendered static elements.
---

The `<NoHydration>` component prevents the client-side hydration process from being applied to its children.
During server-side rendering, components and elements wrapped within `<NoHydration>` will render normally on the server, contributing to the initial HTML output.
However, during client-side hydration, Solid bypasses the hydration process for the content within `<NoHydration>`.
This means that elements within `<NoHydration>` will not have event listeners attached by Solid, and their state will not be managed reactively on the client-side after the initial render.

:::note
Placing a `<Hydration>` component inside `<NoHydration>` has no effect and will not override the `<NoHydration>` behavior.
:::

## Example

```tsx
import { NoHydration } from "solid-js/web";
import { InteractiveComponent, StaticContent } from "./components";

function Example() {
	return (
		<div>
			<InteractiveComponent />
			<NoHydration>
				<StaticContent />
			</NoHydration>
		</div>
	);
}
```
