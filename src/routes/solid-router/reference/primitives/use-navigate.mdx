title: useNavigate
---

Retrieves the method which accepts a path to navigate to and an optional object with the following options:

- resolve (_boolean_, default `true`): resolve the path against the current route
- replace (_boolean_, default `false`): replace the history entry
- scroll (_boolean_, default `true`): scroll to top after navigation
- state (_any_, default `undefined`): pass custom state to `location.state`

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();

if (unauthorized) {
	navigate("/login", { replace: true });
}
```

<Callout>
	The state is serialized using the [structured clone
	algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm)
	which does not support all object types.
