title: Single page applications

When deploying applications that use a client-side router without relying on Server-Side Rendering, it is important that redirects to the index page are handled properly. 
This prevents the CDN or hosting service from returning a "not found" error when accessing URLs that do not correspond to files.

Each provider has a different way of doing this.
For example, Netlify provides a `_redirects` file that contains:

```sh frame="none"
/*   /index.html   200
```

Vercel, on the other hand, requires a rewrites section in your `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
