```ts
function useContext<T>(context: Context<T>): T
```

Used to grab context within a context provider scope to allow for deep passing of props without having to pass them through each Component function.

```ts
const [state, { increment, decrement }] = useContext(CounterContext)
```

## Recommended usage

It is often a good idea to wrap `useContext` in a function like so:

```ts
function useCounterContext() {
	const context = useContext(CounterContext)
	if (!context) {
		throw new Error("useCounterContext: cannot find a CounterContext")
	}
	return context
}
```

See the API reference of [createContext](/reference/component-apis/create-context) for the explanation of what this solves.
