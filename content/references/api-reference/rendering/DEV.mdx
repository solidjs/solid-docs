<Title>DEV</Title>

```ts
const DEV: object | undefined;
```

On the client, Solid provides (via [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports)) different builds depending on whether the __development__ condition is set. Development mode provides some additional checking — e.g. detecting accidental use of multiple instances of Solid — which are removed in production builds.

If you want code to run only in development mode (most useful in libraries), you can check whether the __DEV__ export is defined. Note that it is always defined on the server, so you may want to combine with [isServer](/references/api-reference/rendering/isServer):

```ts
import { DEV } from "solid-js";
import { isServer } from "solid-js/web";

if (DEV && !isServer) {
  console.log(...);
}
```
