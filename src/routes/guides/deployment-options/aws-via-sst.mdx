[SST](https://sst.dev/) is a framework for deploying applications to any cloud provider. It has a built-in way to deploy SolidStart apps to AWS Lambda. For additional details, you can [visit their docs](https://sst.dev/docs/). 

## Quick start

1. Create a SolidStart app.

2. In your project, init SST.

   ```bash
   npx sst@latest init
   ```

3. This will detect your SolidStart app and ask you to update your `app.config.ts`.

   ```ts
   server: {
     preset: "aws-lambda-streaming"
   }
   ```

4. When you are ready, you can deploy your app using:

   ```bash
   npx sst deploy --stage production
   ```

You can [read the full tutorial on the SST docs](https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/solid).

## More options

You can also deploy your SolidStart app to a container using SST. Check out the [SST docs to learn more](https://sst.dev/docs/start/aws/solid).
