```ts
import { observable } from "solid-js"

function observable<T>(input: () => T): Observable<T>

```

This method takes a signal and produces an Observable. 
You can consume it from another Observable library of your choice, typically with the `from` operator.

```ts
// How to integrate rxjs with a Solid signal
import { observable } from "solid-js"
import { from } from "rxjs"

const [s, set] = createSignal(0)

const obsv$ = from(observable(s))

obsv$.subscribe((v) => console.log(v))
```

You can also use `from` without rxjs; check out this [page](/reference/reactive-utilities/from).
