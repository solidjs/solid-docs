  HashRouter enables client-side routing using URL hash values, perfect for
  static file hosting where server-side routing isn't available.
---

The `HashRouter` is a top level component that manages the routing of your application.
It is a client side router that uses hash-values in the URL - providing a single-page application a way to replicate the experience of a multi-page application.

Since hash-routing provides a way for an application to run from a single HTML file, it can be used when hosting on a static file server.

Compared to a browser-router, such as [`Router`](/solid-router/reference/components/router), is that this approach is not SEO friendly.
Because most search engines do not index the hash portion of a URL, they are only able to see the index page of your application when using this approach.

The `root` property is used for components that wrap a matched route and require access to the router context, relevant with navigation components that use [`<A>`](/solid-router/reference/components/a) links.

```tsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { HashRouter, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

const App = (props) => (
	<>
		<h1>Root header</h1>
		{props.children}
	</>
);

render(
	() => <HashRouter root={App}>{/*... routes */}</HashRouter>,
	document.getElementById("app")
);
```
