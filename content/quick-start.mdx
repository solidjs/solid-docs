# Quick Start Guide

## Solid playgrounds

Experience Solid in your browser by visiting our [interactive playground](https://playground.solidjs.com/).

Additionally, we offer some Stackblitz starters, which provide a convenient web-based development environment. 
You can explore the [JavaScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/js) version or opt for our [Typescript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts) one.

## Creating a Solid application

<Aside>
    **Prerequisites:**
    * *Familiarity with the command line*
    * *Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)*
</Aside>

Solid offers convenient project templates that can help kickstart your development. 
To get an application running, follow the steps below based on the language you prefer to use.

### For JavaScript projects

1. Create application using a Solid template:

Solid provides a great JavaScript starter template. 
To create your application structure, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/js my-app
```

2. Navigate to your application's directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
Using npm:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="npm">
```bash
npm install
```
</div>

<div id="yarn">
```bash
yarn install
```
</div>

<div id="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm install
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

4. Run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. 
Now, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` to see your application running.

### For TypeScript projects

Solid also provides a TypeScript template if you'd prefer that. 

1. Create an application using a Solid template:

Solid provides a great TypeScript starter template. 
To create your application structure, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/ts my-app
```

2. Navigate to your application's directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```
Alternatively, you can use yarn or pnpm:
```bash
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. 
Now, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` to see your application running.

#### Explore more templates

Solid offers a variety of Vite templates to streamline your development process. 
These resources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/solidjs/templates).

## Setting up environment variables

Solid is built on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which offers a convenient way to handle environment variables. The following steps will show how to set up environment varaibles in a Solid project:

1. In the root directory of the project, create a file called `.env`. 
This file will store environment variables in the `key = value` format.

<Aside>
**Note:** To prevent accidental exposure of environment variables to the client, only variables prefixed with `VITE_` will be exposed.

For example:
```
VITE_SECRET_KEY = 123hello
DB_PASSWORD = foobar
```

Only the `VITE_SECRET_KEY` will be exposed to client source code, while `DB_PASSWORD` will not, as shown below.

```js
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_SECRET_KEY) // 123hello
console.log(import.meta.env.DB_PASSWORD) // undefined
```
</Aside>
    
2. In your Solid code, you can access environment variables using `import.meta.env`. 
Vite will automatically inject the environment variables into your application.
```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Component with environment variable used {import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME}</h2>
    </div>
  )
}
export default MyComponent;
```
For more information on environment variables in Vite and enabling TypeScript intellisense for environment variables, please refer to the [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files).
