title: createComputed
---

```ts
function createComputed<T>(fn: (v: T) => T, value?: T): void

```

`createComputed` creates a new computation that immediately runs the given function in a tracking scope, thus automatically tracking its dependencies, and automatically reruns the function whenever the dependencies changes. 
The function gets called with an argument equal to the value returned from the function's last execution, or on the first call, equal to the optional second argument to `createComputed`. 
Note that the return value of the function is not otherwise exposed; in particular, createComputed has no return value.

`createComputed` is the most immediate form of reactivity in Solid, and is most useful for building other reactive primitives. 
For example, some other Solid primitives are built from `createComputed`. 
However, it should be used with care, as `createComputed` can easily cause more unnecessary updates than other reactive primitives. 
Before using it, consider the closely related primitives [`createMemo`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-memo) and [`createRenderEffect`](/reference/secondary-primitives/create-render-effect).

Like `createMemo`, `createComputed` calls its function immediately on updates (unless you're in a [batch](/reference/reactive-utilities/batch), [effect](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-effect), or [transition](/reference/reactive-utilities/use-transition)). 
However, while `createMemo` functions should be pure (not set any signals), `createComputed` functions can set signals. 
Related, `createMemo` offers a readonly signal for the return value of the function, whereas to do the same with `createComputed` you would need to set a signal within the function. 
If it is possible to use pure functions and `createMemo`, this is likely more efficient, as Solid optimizes the execution order of memo updates, whereas updating a signal within `createComputed` will immediately trigger reactive updates some of which may turn out to be unnecessary.
