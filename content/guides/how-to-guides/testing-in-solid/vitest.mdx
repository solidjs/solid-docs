## What is Vitest?

Vitest is a really fast unit test framework built on top of [Vite](vitejs.dev/). It's quick to get started with, and it's easy to write tests for your components. Vitest isn't made primarily for testing frontend components but with the addition of some awesome packages we can make use of it in order to test our Solid components.

#### Packages
* [JSDOM](github.com/jsdom/jsdom)
* [JestDOM](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom/)
* [Solid.js Testing Library](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-testing-library)
* [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

## Getting Started

First let's get started with the installations. We'll need to install the packages listed above. 

```bash
npm i -D vitest jsdom @testing-library/jest-dom @solidjs/testing-library
# or
yarn add -D vitest jsdom @testing-library/jest-dom @solidjs/testing-library
```

#### Configuring Vitest

Now that we've installed the necessary packages, we'll need to configure vitest to work with Solid. Let's create a `vitest.config.ts` file in the root of our project. 

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import solidPlugin from 'vite-plugin-solid';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [solidPlugin()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  build: {
    target: 'esnext',
  },
  test:{
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    testTransformMode: { web: ["/\.[jt]sx?$/"] },
  }
});
```

**Note:** Do not forget to add the `reference` types at the top of the file. If you do not add them, you will get a type error when you try to run your tests.

Once we've created the config file, we'll need to add a script to our `package.json` file. 

```diff
{
  "name": "solid-app-name",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "vite",
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview",
+   "test": "vitest"
  },
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@solidjs/testing-library": "^0.5.1",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
    "jsdom": "^20.0.3",
    "typescript": "^4.9.4",
    "vite": "^4.0.3",
    "vite-plugin-solid": "^2.5.0",
    "vitest": "^0.26.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "solid-js": "^1.6.6"
  }
}

```

Now that we've added the script, we can run our tests by running `npm run test` or `yarn test`. However, there are no tests to run so we'll need to create some.

## Creating Tests

In Typescript/Javascript test files can be created with the `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension. Tests are usually kept in their seperate folder in the root of the project, most developers like to name this folder `tests` or `__tests__`. However in some cases you may want to keep your tests in the same folder as the component you're testing. Explore the different styles and find what works best for you 🙂.

#### Creating a Test File

In Solid we recommend creating a `test` folder to house all your test files in. Let's create a `test` folder in the root of our project and create a `App.test.ts` file inside of it. 

```bash
mkdir test
touch test/App.test.tsx
```

Now that we've created the test file, let's add some tests. 

```ts
import { render } from '@solidjs/testing-library';
import App from '../src/App';
import { describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'; // 👈 this is imported in order to use the jest-dom matchers 

describe('App', () => {
  it('should render the app', () => {
    const { getByText } = render(() => <App/>);
    expect(getByText('Learn Solid')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

The above test will test to see if the phrase `Learn Solid` is in the `App` component once it is rendered. If it is, the test will pass. If it isn't, the test will fail. The snippet above is an example of a component test.

## Testing Components

Let's take a simple click counter component:

```tsx
//counter.tsx
import { createSignal, Component } from "solid-js";

export const Counter: Component = () => {
  const [getCount, setCount] = createSignal(0);

  return (
    <div role="button" onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>
      Count: {getCount()}
    </div>
  );
};
```

Here we use `solid-testing-library`. It's most important helpers are `render` to render a component to the DOM in a managed way, `fireEvent` to dispatch events in a way that resembles actual user events and `screen` to provide global selectors. We also use helpful assertions added to `expect` provided by `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

Let's create a test file for our `Counter` component:

```ts
// counter.test.tsx
import { Counter } from "../src/counter";
import { cleanup, fireEvent, render, screen } from "@solidjs/testing-library";
import { describe, expect, it, afterEach } from 'vitest';
import "@testing-library/jest-dom"

describe("Counter", () => {
  afterEach(cleanup);

  it("it starts with zero", () => {
    render(() => <Counter />);

    const button = screen.getByRole("button");

    expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(button).toHaveTextContent("Count: 0");
  });

  it("it increases its value on click", async () => {
    render(() => <Counter />);

    const button = screen.getByRole("button");

    fireEvent.click(button);
    // the event loop takes one Promise to resolve to be finished
    await Promise.resolve();
    expect(button).toHaveTextContent("Count: 1");
    fireEvent.click(button);
    await Promise.resolve();
    expect(button).toHaveTextContent("Count: 2");
  });
});
```

The test above tests the `counter` component to see if it renders the correct text and if it increments the count when clicked.

## Testing Reactive State 

You may want to keep parts of your state separate from the components for ease of maintenance or being able to support multiple views. In this case, the interface against which you are testing is the state itself. Keep in mind that out of a reactive root (i.e `createRoot`) your state is not tracked and updates won't trigger effects and memos.

As an example let's create and test a function called createLocalStorage that will create a reactive state that is persisted in the browser's local storage.

<CodeTabs
  js={[{ name: "createLocalStorage.jsx", component: createLocalStorageJS }]}
  ts={[{ name: "createLocalStorage.tsx", component: createLocalStorageTS }]}
/>

Instead of creating a component we can test this function directly in isolation. When doing that we need to keep in mind that:
1. reactive changes only work when they have a tracking context provided by render or createRoot
2. that they are asynchronous, but we can use createEffect to catch them

Using createRoot has the advantage that we can trigger the disposal manually:

```ts
import { createRoot, createEffect } from "solid-js";
import { createLocalStorage } from "../src/createLocalStorage"; // 👈 our function
import { describe, expect, it, beforeEach } from 'vitest';

describe("createLocalStorage", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    localStorage.clear();
  });

  const initialState = {
    todos: [],
    newTitle: ""
  }

  it("reads pre-existing state from localStorage", () => {
    createRoot((dispose) => {
      const savedState = {
        todos: [{ title: "Learn Solid" }],
        newTitle: "Learn Solid"
      };

      localStorage.setItem("state", JSON.stringify(savedState));
      const [state] = createLocalStorage("state", initialState);

      expect(state).toEqual(savedState);
      dispose();
    })
  });

  it("stores new state to localStorage", () => {
    createRoot((dispose) => {
      const [state, setState] = createLocalStorage("state", initialState);

      setState("newTitle", "updated");

      return new Promise((resolve) => createEffect(() => {
        expect(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("state") || "")).toEqual({
          todos: [],
          newTitle: "updated",
        });
        dispose()
        resolve()
      })
    })
  });

  it("updates state multiple times", async () => {
    const { dispose, setState } = createRoot((dispose) => {
      const [state, setState] = createLocalStore("state",initialState);
      return { dispose, setState };
    });

    setState("newTitle", "first");
    // wait a tick to resolve all effects
    await new Promise((done) => setTimeout(done, 0));
    expect(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("state") || "")).toEqual({
      todos: [],
      newTitle: "first",
    });

    setState("newTitle", "second");
    // wait a tick to resolve all effects
    await new Promise((done) => setTimeout(done, 0));
    expect(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("state") || "")).toEqual({
      todos: [],
      newTitle: "second",
    });
    dispose();
  })
})
```

That's it! You can now test your Solid apps with confidence. For more information on testing frontend apps, check out the [JestDOM testing library](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom) and the [Vitest testing framework](https://vitest.dev/)
