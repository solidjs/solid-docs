<title>Fetching Data</title>

# Fetching Data

Our Bookshelf application is almost complete, but let's be honest&mdash;we live in a dynamic world. Our applications are hardly ever self-contained. This is why Solid includes the concept of _resources_ out of the box. Resources are special signals designed specifically to handle asynchronous loading and are created using the `createResource` function.

Resources are often triggered by signals themselves, and a common pattern you will see in Solid apps is for `createResource` to be passed two parameters: a signal and a data fetching function that relies on that signal:

```tsx
const [data] = createResource(signal, dataFetchingFunction);
```

The data returned from our `dataFetchingFunction` will be available when we call `data()` (like a normal signal). Additionally, `data.loading` and `data.error` properties will be available to us so we can condition our application's display based on data fetching state.

(Add advanced aside here about more advanced functionality with the second element of the tuple)

## Fetching data for the bookshelf

In our Bookshelf application, we're not going to force our users to type the full book name and author of each book: we'll use an API to lookup books and we'll manage that asynchronous state using Solid resources.

Fortunately, [OpenLibrary.org](https://openlibrary.org/) provides an excellent, free API that we can use to look up books by their titles. For example, `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=Lord%20of%20the%20Rings` will perform a search for the book "Lord of the Rings" and we wil be able to get the book's official title and author.

Let's first write a data fetching fucntion called `searchBooks` based on this API. The function will take a search term and return an array of matches from the OpenLibrary.org API:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App5js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook3js },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
      { name: "searchBooks.js*", component: SearchBooksjs, default: true },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App5ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook3ts },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
      { name: "searchBooks.ts*", component: SearchBooksts, default: true },
    ],
  }}
/>

This code fetches data from the OpenLibrary.org API, selects the first 10 results, and then transforms the results a bit to only return `title` and `author` properties for each result.

Let's set this data-fetching function aside for a moment so we can refactor our `AddBooks.tsx` component. It currently consists of a form that lets users enter _both_ the title and author of a book they want to add to their bookshelf.

Now that we know we'll be using the OpenLibrary.org API, we can simplify this form a bit: we're just going to ask users to search for a book by its title. The text the user is typing will be tracking in the `input` signal. Once the user hits the `Search` button, the current value of the `input` signal will be stored in the `query` signal.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App5js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx*", component: AddBook4js, default: true },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
      { name: "searchBooks.js", component: SearchBooksjs },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App5ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx*", component: AddBook4ts, default: true },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
      { name: "searchBooks.ts", component: SearchBooksts },
    ],
  }}
/>

Now that we have our source signal, `query`, and our data-fetching function, `searchBooks`, we can use `createSignal` to query the OpenLibrary.org API! As a reminder, `createResource` will take the source signal and data-fetcher function as arguments:

```tsx
const [data] = createResource(query, searchBooks);
```

Knowing that we'll have access to `data.loading` when we're in a loading state, we can display "Searching..." when data is loading or a list of results when data is loaded. This combines both `<Show />` and `<For />` control flow concepts that we learned in the previous tutorial.

```tsx
const [data] = createResource(query, searchBooks);

<Show when={!data.loading} fallback={<>Searching...</>}>
  <ul>
    <For each={data()}>
      {(book) => (
        <li>
          {books.title} by {book.author} <button>Add</button>
        </li>
      )}
    </For>
  </ul>
</Show>;
```

Finally, we'll want to make sure we the `<button />` in each list item adds the item to our book list.

```tsx
const [data] = createResource(query, searchBooks);

<Show when={!data.loading} fallback={<>Searching...</>}>
  <ul>
    <For each={data()}>
      {(book) => (
        <li>
          {books.title} by {book.author}{" "}
          <button
            aria-label={`Add ${book.title} by ${book.author} to the bookshelf`}
            onClick={() => {
              props.setBooks((books) => [...books, book]);
            }}
          >
            Add
          </button>
        </li>
      )}
    </For>
  </ul>
</Show>;
```

<Aside type="accessibility">

We can include an `aria-label` on our Add button to make the action taken by the button clear to screen readers. As a matter of principle, Solid will never get in the way of writing accessible code.

## Finishing the app

Let's plug this resource fetching and display codee into our `AddBook` file, which will complete the application:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App5js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx*", component: AddBook5js, default: true },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
      { name: "searchBooks.js", component: SearchBooksjs },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App5ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx*", component: AddBook5ts, default: true },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
      { name: "searchBooks.ts", component: SearchBooksts },
    ],
  }}
/>

<FinishedBookshelf name="Solid" />

## Congratulations!

You just built your first Solid app! You now know how to build user interfaces, manage state, conditionally display information, and dynamically fetch content using Solid.
