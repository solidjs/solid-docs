Solid is a declarative JavaScript framework for building fast, reactive user interfaces. 
With its fine-grained reactivity system and compilation-driven approach, Solid delivers exceptional performance while maintaining a developer-friendly experience similar to React.

## What Makes Solid Different?

Solid takes a unique approach to building web applications through **fine-grained reactivity**. Unlike frameworks that rely on a Virtual DOM, Solid compiles your components into optimized JavaScript that updates the real DOM directly—only changing what needs to change, when it needs to change.

This means your applications are faster, more memory-efficient, and more responsive out of the box.

## Core Principles

- **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Solid tracks dependencies at the most granular level, ensuring only affected parts of your UI update when data changes.
- **No Virtual DOM**: Direct DOM updates eliminate diffing overhead and improve performance.
- **Compilation-Based**: Components are compiled at build time into highly optimized JavaScript with minimal runtime overhead.
- **Familiar Syntax**: JSX-based components make Solid approachable for developers coming from React.
- **TypeScript First**: Built with TypeScript support from the ground up for a robust development experience.

## Why Choose Solid?

### Performance

Solid consistently ranks at the top of JavaScript framework benchmarks. By eliminating the Virtual DOM and leveraging true reactivity, Solid achieves rendering speeds that rival vanilla JavaScript.

### Developer Experience

Write components using familiar JSX syntax while enjoying a simple, predictable API. Solid's reactivity primitives (`createSignal`, `createEffect`, `createMemo`) are intuitive and powerful, eliminating the need for complex state management libraries.

### Small Bundle Size

Solid's core is only a few kilobytes, making it ideal for performance-critical applications and mobile-first development.

### Modern Features

- Built-in support for Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Streaming and progressive hydration
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Flexible routing and state management
- Growing ecosystem of tools and libraries

## Who Is Solid For?

Solid is perfect for:
- Developers seeking maximum performance without sacrificing developer experience
- Teams building complex, interactive applications
- Projects where bundle size and runtime efficiency matter
- Developers familiar with React looking for a more performant alternative
