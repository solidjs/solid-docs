[Northflank](https://northflank.com) is a full-stack platform for deploying applications, containers, jobs, and managed databases, complete with built-in CI/CD and automated cloud infrastructure. 
For a full overview of available features and deployment methods, you can refer to their [documentation](https://northflank.com/docs).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, create a [Northflank account](https://app.northflank.com/signup) and [link your git provider](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/getting-started/link-your-git-account).

## Step 1: Pick a build method
Northflank supports two deployment options for SolidJS applications:

- **Dockerfile:** Full control over build/runtime.
- **Buildpack:** Simplified Node.js deployment. Ensure your `package.json` includes a proper `start` script.

## Step 2: Create a project
- In your Northflank dashboard, click `Create new` → `Project`.
- Give your project a name (e.g., solidjs-project) and optionally choose a color for easy identification.
- Select your deployment target: Northflank Cloud (managed infrastructure) or Bring Your Own Cloud (connect AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-prem resources).
- Pick a region close to your users to minimize latency.
- Click `Create project` to finalize.

## Step 3: Deploy your app
In your project, navigate to the `Services` tab in the top menu and click `Create New Service`. Select Combined and name your service, for example, `solid-app`.
For the Repository, link to your app repository.

**Select Build Option:** 

Choose Dockerfile/Buildpack for deployment.

**Select compute resources:**

Choose the compute size that best matches your workload:
- Small plans are fine for lightweight usage.
- Larger plans are recommended for heavy usage.

> Note: You can adjust resources later, so you can start small and scale as needed.

**Set up a port so your app is accessible:**
- Port: 8080
- Protocol: HTTP
- Public access: enable this to let people access your app from the internet

Northflank will automatically generate a secure, unique public URL for your service.

Click `Create service` to deploy your app. 

Once successful, you’ll see the public URL in the top right corner. e.g.: `p01--solid-app--lppg6t2b6kzf.code.run`
