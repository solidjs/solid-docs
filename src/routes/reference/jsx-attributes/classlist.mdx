Solid offers two attributes to set the class of an element: `class` and `classList`.

First, `class` can be set like other attributes. For example:

```tsx
// Two static classes
<div class="active editing" />

// One dynamic class, deleting class attribute if it's not needed
<div class={state.active ? 'active' : undefined} />

// Two dynamic classes
<div class={`${state.active ? 'active' : ''} ${state.currentId === row.id ? 'editing' : ''}`} />
```

	Note that <code>className</code> was deprecated in Solid 1.4 in favor of {" "}
	<code>class</code>.

Alternatively, the `classList` pseudo-attribute lets you specify an object, where each key is a class and the value is treated as a boolean representing whether to include that class. For example (matching the last example):

```tsx
<div
	classList={{ 
		active: state.active,
		editing: state.currentId === row.id,
	}}
/>
```

This example compiles to a render effect that dynamically calls [element.classList.toggle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList/toggle) to turn each class on or off, only when the corresponding boolean changes. For example, when `state.active` becomes true [false], the element gains [loses] the `active` class.

The value passed into `classList` can be any expression (including a signal getter) that evaluates to an appropriate object. Some examples:

```tsx
// Dynamic class name and value
<div classList={{ [className()]: classOn() }} />

// Signal class list
const [classes, setClasses] = createSignal({})
setClasses((c) => ({ ...c, active: true }))
<div classList={classes()} />
```

While possible, mixing `class` and `classList` in Solid can lead to unexpected behavior.
The safest approach is to use a static string (or nothing) for `class` and keep `classList` reactive.
You can also use a static computed value for class, such as `class={baseClass()}`, however you must make sure it comes before any `classList` pseudo-attributes.
If both `class` and `classList` are reactive, changes to `class` will overwrite the entire `class` attribute, potentially undoing any updates made by `classList`.

Because classList is a compile-time pseudo-attribute, it does not work in a prop spread like `<div {...props} />` or in `<Dynamic>`.
