WE'RE WORKING ON THIS

Writing Principles

- Friendly tone! Approachable > technical
  - Lowest common denominator vocabulary. The helpfulness of the docs depend on how accessible they are.
  - Reader-tests help with this! Test with “real” users; people who have the preexisting knowledge (or lack thereof) that you assume in your piece.
- Show, don’t tell
  - Don’t say that something is obvious or simple; show that it is with an example.
  - “Picture paints a thousand words” -> code examples & diagrams can accomplish a lot before you get to the explanatory paragraph.
- Establish the context; set expectations
  - Before you write, establish what the reader knows beforehand and where you want them to end up. Then as you write, make those expectations clear.
  - There’s a balance between thoroughness and conciseness. New concepts are “expensive” to learn. Ask yourself: is it worth explaining this here?
