  Access development-only features in SolidJS with the DEV export. Enable
  additional checks and debugging tools that are removed in production.
---

```ts
import { DEV } from "solid-js"

const DEV: object | undefined
```

On the client, Solid provides (via [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports)) different builds depending on whether the **development** condition is set. 
Development mode provides some additional checking — e.g. detecting accidental use of multiple instances of Solid — which are removed in production builds.

If you want code to run only in development mode (most useful in libraries), you can check whether the **DEV** export is defined. 
Note that it is always defined on the server, so you may want to combine with [isServer](/reference/rendering/is-server):

```ts
import { DEV } from "solid-js"
import { isServer } from "solid-js/web"

if (DEV && !isServer) {
  console.log(...);
}
```
