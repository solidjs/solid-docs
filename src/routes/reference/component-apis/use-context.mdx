Used to grab context within a context provider scope to allow for deep passing of props without having to pass them through each Component function.
It's therefore used in conjunction with [`createContext`](/reference/component-apis/create-context) to consume the data from a Provider scope and thus avoid passing data through intermediate components (prop drilling).

```ts
const [state, { increment, decrement }] = useContext(CounterContext)
```

## Recommended usage

It is often a good idea to wrap `useContext` in a function like so:

```ts title="/context/counter-component.tsx"
function useCounterContext() {
	const context = useContext(CounterContext)

	if (!context) {
		throw new Error("useCounterContext: cannot find a CounterContext")
	}

	return context
}
```

See the API reference of [createContext](/reference/component-apis/create-context) the API on how to generate a Provider scope.
And check the [Context concepts](/concepts/context) for more information on how to architecture your contexts.

## Type signature

```ts
import { type Context } from "solid-js"

function useContext<T>(context: Context<T>): T

```
