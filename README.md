# Solid Docs

This is the working repository for our new docs effort. The infrastructure is built on [SolidStart](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start) and the content structure and goals are inspired by [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) and the [React Beta Docs.](https://diataxis.fr/)

## Running the Site

Our [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/solidjs/solid-docs-next/) or [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next) or links are the quickest way to set up a development environment, which lets you browse and edit the project files and run the resulting site locally.

We use **npm** as our a package manager. If you [clone this project](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) locally, [install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), then run these commands to start the project:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The Solid Docs Manifesto

1. <h4>Documentation is a product.</h4> A product has users, and product teams design, engineer, and maintain solutions that serve them. We’re not writing text that describes SolidJS, we’re using everything at our disposal to teach SolidJS and make our users feel great about themselves throughout the learning process.
2. <h4>Documentation is <em>the product</em>.</h4> The SolidJS user experience depends on the docs. The Docs Team cares about the entire onboarding and learning experience, which extends beyond written docs into examples, videos, and templates. SolidJS is not an independent project from its docs, and docs are a Core concern.
3. <h4>Documentation is inclusive and collaborative.</h4> The best docs are not written by the most experienced or entrenched user, they’re not written with one user in mind, and they’re not written alone. The Docs Team seeks to recruit contributors across a wide range of disciplines, perspectives, and experiences, and to foster an environment where every voice is heard.
4. <h4>Documentation is accessible.</h4> Language, disability, and background should not be a barrier to learning SolidJS. Any user that wants to learn or teach SolidJS must be able to, and docs can enable skills and experiences previously closed off to someone.
5. <h4>Documentation is fun.</h4> It feels and should feel amazing to learn a new skill, and it should certainly feel great to teach it. We’re a community of volunteers, and that community matters: we care about our users, and we care about each other.
