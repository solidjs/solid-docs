title: "Route pre-rendering"
---

SolidStart offers a way to pre-render pages at build time.
The easiest way to accomplish this, is by passing a list of routes to be pre-rendered to the `routes` option.

```js { 6 }
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    prerender: {
      routes: ["/", "/about"]
    }
  }
});
```

When you wish for all your routes to be pre-rendered, you can pass `true` to the `crawlLinks` option:

```js { 6 }
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    prerender: {
      crawlLinks: true
    }
  }
});
```
