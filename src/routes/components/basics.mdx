Components are the **fundamental building blocks** of Solid applications.  
A component is a **JavaScript function that returns JSX**.
This allows you to create encapsulated pieces of UI that can manage their own state and behavior.

## Your First Component

A component starts as a plain JavaScript function, defined by either a function declaration or an arrow function:

```tsx
// Greeting.jsx
export function Greeting() {
  return <div>Hello, Solid!</div>;
}

export const Greeting = () => {
  return <div>Hello, Solid!</div>;
};
```

These functions can be used in other components by importing them and using their names like HTML tags:

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { Greeting } from './Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Passing Props

Props, short for properties, let you pass data from a parent component to a child component.
They are passed as attributes on the component tag and received as an object in the component function.

```tsx
//Greeting.tsx
export function Greeting(props) {
  return <div>Hello, {props.name}!</div>;
}

// App.tsx
import { Greeting } from './Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Solid" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

To learn more about props, see the next section: [Passing Data with Props](/components/props).

### Composing Components

Components can be composed together to build more complex UIs. 
You can use one component inside another, passing props as needed.

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { Greeting } from './Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Solid" />
      <Greeting name="World" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Component lifecycles

Components in Solid have a lifecycle that includes mounting, updating, and unmounting phases.

1. **Mounting**: When the component is being created and inserted into the DOM. 
It occurs once in the component's lifecycle.
2. **Updating**: The component's state or props change, causing it to re-render. Solid optimizes updates to ensure minimal re-rendering.
3. **Unmounting**: The component is removed from the DOM. 
Cleanup tasks, such as cancelling network requests or removing event listeners, should be performed here.

There are certain lifecycle helpers available in Solid to manage these phases more easily, such as `onMount`, `onCleanup`, and `createEffect`.

```tsx
import { onMount, onCleanup } from "solid-js";

function Timer() {
  let interval;

  onMount(() => {
    interval = setInterval(() => console.log("tick"), 1000);
  });

  onCleanup(() => clearInterval(interval));

  return <p>Timer running...</p>;
}
```
