Once your routes have been created within an application, [anchor tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) can be used to help users navigate between different views or pages.

```jsx {4-5}
const App = (props) => (
	<>
		<nav>
			<a href="/users">Users</a>
			<a href="/">Home</a>
		</nav>
		<h1>My Site with lots of pages</h1>
		{props.children}
	</>
);
```

## `<A>` component

While you can use the native HTML anchor tag, Solid Router does provide a [`<A>`](/solid-router/reference/components/a) component. 
While similar to an anchor tag, the `<A>` component supports automatically applying the base URL path and relative paths.

```jsx {4-5}
const App = (props) => (
	<>
    <nav>
        <A href="/">Home</A>
        <A href="/users">Users</A>
    </nav>
    <h1>My Site with lots of pages</h1>
    {props.children}
	</>
);
```

### Styling links

In addition, the `<A>` component also provides an `active` and `inactive` prop.
This prop accepts a string that, when provided, will apply the specified class to the anchor tag based on the current route.
If the current route matches the `href` prop, the `active` class will be applied, otherwise the `inactive` class will be applied.

```jsx
<A href="/users" active="underlined" inactive="default">
	Users
</A>
```

### Matching routes

By default, matching using the `<A>` component will include locations that are _descendants_ of the specified route. This would include `/users`, `/users/1`, `/users/1/posts`, etc. if `/users` is the specified route.

```jsx
// Will match /users and /users/1
<A href="/users">
    Users
</A>
```
To match the exact route only, you can use the `end` prop:

```jsx
// Will match /users/1 only
<A href="/users/1" end>
    User 1
</A>
```
