title: hydrate
---

```ts
function hydrate(fn: () => JSX.Element, node: MountableElement): () => void

```

This method is similar to **render** except it attempts to rehydrate what is already rendered to the DOM. 
When initializing in the browser a page has already been server rendered.

```ts
const dispose = hydrate(App, document.getElementById("app"))
```
