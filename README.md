## What is Solid?

Solid is a JavaScript framework used for building high-performance
user-interfaces. Using a reactive approach and component-based architecture, we
want to empower developers in creating efficient and scalable web applications.

## Running the Site Locally

At the moment, we recommend running the site locally through either
[﻿CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/solidjs/solid-docs-next/),
[﻿Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next), or
[﻿StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/solid-docs-next). These are
the quickest and easiest way to browse and edit the project files and run the
site locally.

> **Note**: To run this project through your own IDE at this time, you will need
> to run _Node v16.19.0._ This may require using a
