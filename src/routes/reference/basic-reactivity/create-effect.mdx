  Learn how to use createEffect to run side effects when reactive dependencies
  change. Perfect for DOM manipulation and external library integration.
---

The `createEffect` primitive creates a reactive computation.
It automatically tracks reactive values, such as [signals](/concepts/signals), accessed within the provided function.
This function will re-run whenever any of its dependencies change.

## Execution Timing

### Initial Run

- The initial run of effects is **scheduled to occur after the current rendering phase completes**.
- It runs after all synchronous code in a component has finished and DOM elements have been created, but **before the browser paints them on the screen**.
- **[Refs](/concepts/refs) are set** before the first run, even though DOM nodes may not yet be attached to the main document tree.
  This is relevant when using the [`children`](/reference/component-apis/children) helper.

### Subsequent Runs

- After the initial run, the effect **re-runs whenever any tracked dependency changes**.
- When multiple dependencies change within the same batch, the effect **runs once per batch**.
- The **order of runs** among multiple effects is **not guaranteed**.
- Effects always run **after** all pure computations (such as [memos](/concepts/derived-values/memos)) within the same update cycle.

### Server-Side Rendering

- Effects **never run during SSR**.
- Effects also **do not run during the initial client hydration**.

## Import

```ts
import { createEffect } from "solid-js";
```

## Type

```ts
function createEffect<Next>(
	fn: EffectFunction<undefined | NoInfer<Next>, Next>
): void;
function createEffect<Next, Init = Next>(
	fn: EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>,
	value: Init,
	options?: { name?: string }
): void;
function createEffect<Next, Init>(
	fn: EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>,
	value?: Init,
	options?: { name?: string }
): void;
```

## Parameters

### `fn`

- **Type:** `EffectFunction<undefined | NoInfer<Next> | EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>`
- **Required:** Yes

A function to be executed as the effect.

It receives the value returned from the previous run, or the initial `value` during the first run.
The value returned by `fn` is passed to the next run.

### `value`

- **Type:** `Init`
- **Required:** No

The initial value passed to `fn` during its first run.

### `options`

- **Type:** `{ name?: string }`
- **Required:** No

An optional configuration object with the following properties:

#### `name`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** No

A name for the effect, which can be useful for identification in debugging tools like the [Solid Debugger](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools).

## Return value

`createEffect` does not return a value.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

	// Every time count changes, this effect re-runs.
	createEffect(() => {
		console.log("Count incremented! New value: ", count());
	});

	return (
		<div>
			<p>Count: {count()}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

### Execution Timing

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect, createRenderEffect } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

	// This is part of the component's synchronous execution.
	console.log("Hello from counter");

	// This effect is scheduled to run after the initial render is complete.
	createEffect(() => {
		console.log("Effect:", count());
	});

	// By contrast, a render effect runs synchronously during the render phase.
	createRenderEffect(() => {
		console.log("Render effect:", count());
	});

	// Setting a signal during the render phase re-runs render effects, but not effects, which are
	// still scheduled.
	setCount(1);

	// A microtask is scheduled to run after the current synchronous code (the render phase) finishes.
	queueMicrotask(() => {
		// Now that rendering is complete, signal updates will trigger effects immediately.
		setCount(2);
	});
}

// Output:
// Hello from counter
// Render effect: 0
// Render effect: 1
// Effect: 1
// Render effect: 2
// Effect: 2
```
