Solid is a modern JavaScript framework designed to build responsive and high-performing user interfaces.
It prioritizes a simple, yet predictable, developer experience, making it a great choice for developers of all skill levels.

## What is Solid?

As a JavaScript framework, Solid embraces reactivity and fine-grained updates.
What this means is that Solid can efficiently update the user interface by only re-rendering the parts of the UI that have changed, rather than the entire page. 

Traditionally, when a change occurs, the entire page would need to reload to display the updated information.
With Solid's fine-grained reactive system, updates are only applied to the parts of the page that need to be updated.
This decreases work and can result in faster load times as well as a smoother user experience overall.
