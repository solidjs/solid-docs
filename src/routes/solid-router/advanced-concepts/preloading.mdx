title: Preloading
---

Anchors in Solid Router will preload routes by default on link hover/focus to improve perceived performance.

To enhance preloading, you can define the `preload` function on your route definition.
When on a [SolidStart](/solid-start) application, this function can also run on the server during the initial page load to start fetching data before rendering. When in a Single-Page Application (SPA), it will load the route's component and its `preload` function when the user hovers or focuses on a link.

| user action | route behavior                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| hover   | with a 300ms delay to avoid excessive preloading  |
| focus   | immediately                           |

## Imperative Preloading

You can also use the [`usePreloadRoute`](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-preload-route) helper to preload routes programmatically in response to events other than link hover/focus, such as button clicks or timers.
This helper will load only the route's component by default, but it can receive a configuration object to also load the data.

## Preloading and Lazy Loading

When a route has nested lazy components, such components will not be part of the route hierarchy, so they **will not** be preloaded with the route. To preload such components, you can use the `preload()` function returned from calling the [`lazy()`](https://docs.solidjs.com/reference/component-apis/lazy) component API.

To learn more about lazy loading components, see the [`lazy`](/reference/component-apis/lazy#preloading-data-in-nested-lazy-components) documentation.
