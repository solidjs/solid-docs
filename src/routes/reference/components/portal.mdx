title: <Portal>
---

`<Portal>` is a component that allows you to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

This is useful when your UI has some elements that need to appear on top of everything else, such as modals and tooltips.

```tsx
function Portal(props: {
	mount?: Node
	useShadow?: boolean
	isSVG?: boolean
	children: JSX.Element
}): Text
```

This inserts the element in the mount node. 
Useful for inserting Modals outside of the page layout. 
Events still propagate through the component hierarchy, however `<Portal>` will only run on the client and has hydration _disabled_.

The portal is mounted in a `<div>` unless the target is the document head. 
`useShadow` places the element in a Shadow Root for style isolation, and `isSVG` is required if inserting into an SVG element so that the `<div>` is not inserted.

```tsx
<Portal mount={document.getElementById("modal")}>
	<div>My Content</div>
</Portal>
```
