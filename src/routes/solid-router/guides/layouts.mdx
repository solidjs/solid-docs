To maintain consistency across an application's page you can use layouts. 
Layouts are components that wrap the content of a route and can be used to define a common structure for all pages or specific sections of an application.


## Root-level layouts

A root-level layout acts as a container surrounding all routes within your application._createMdxContentTo define a route-level layout, pass the layout component to the `root` prop of the `Router` component:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

import Home from "./pages/Home";

const Layout = (props) => {
    return (
        <>
            <header>
                <h1>Site header</h1>
            </header>
            {props.children}
            <footer>
                <p>&copy; 2024 My Site</p>
            </footer>
        </>
    );
};

render(
    () => (
        <Router root={Layout}>
            <Route path="/" component={Home} />
            <Route path="/hello-world" component={<span>Hello world!</span>} />

        </Router>
    ),
    document.getElementById("app")
);
```

With the root-level layout, the `props,children` within the layout component will be replaced with the content of current route.
This means that while the words "Header" and "Footer" will be displayed on every page, the content between them will change depending on the current route.
For example, when the route is `/hello-world`, you will see the text "Hello world!" between the header and footer.

## Nested layouts

Nested layouts create a hierarchy structure for layouts.
Routes can be nested within each other to apply different layouts to different sections of an application.

```html title="Output"
<header>
    <h1>Site header</h1>
</header>
    <span>Hello world!</span>
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2024 My Site</p>
</footer>
```
