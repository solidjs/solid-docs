title: "Path parameters"

Parameters within a route are used to capture dynamic values from the URL. 
This is useful for creating routes that are more flexible and can handle different values.

```jsx
<Route path="/users/:id" component={User} />

```

In this example, the `:id` parameter will capture any value that comes after `/users/` in the URL.
The colon `:` is used to denote a parameter, and `id` is the name of the parameter.
When a URL matches this route, the `User` component will be rendered.

<Callout title="Animations & Transitions">
Routes that share the same path match will be treated as the same route.
If a force re-render is needed, you can wrap your component in a keyed [`Show`](/reference/components/show) component:

```jsx
<Show when={params.something} keyed>
  <MyComponent />
</Show>

```

</Callout>

## Accessing parameters

You can retrieve the values captured by parameters using [`useParams`](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-params).

```jsx frame="terminal" title="http://localhost:3000/users/123"
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";

function User() {
    const params = useParams();
    return <div>User ID: {params.id}</div>; {/* Output: User ID: 123 */}
}

```

## Validating parameters

Each path parameter can be validated using the `MatchFilter` on the `Route` component.
Rather than checking for the presence of a parameter manually, you can use a `MatchFilter` to ensure that the parameter is in the correct format.

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

const User = import("./pages/User");

const filters = {
  parent: ["mom", "dad"], // allow enum values
  id: /^\d+$/, // only allow numbers
  withHtmlExtension: (v: string) => v.length > 5 && v.endsWith(".html"), // we want an `*.html` extension
};

render(() => (
  <Router>
    <Route
      path="/users/:parent/:id/:withHtmlExtension"
      component={User}
      matchFilters={filters}
    />
  </Router>
), document.getElementById("app"));

```

Here, the `matchFilter` prop validates the `parent`, `id`, and `withHtmlExtension` parameters against the specified filters defined in the `filters` object.
If the validation fails, the route will not match and the component will not be rendered.

In this example, that means:
- `/users/mom/123/contact.html` would match,
- `/users/dad/456/about.html` would match,
- `/users/aunt/123/contact.html` would not match as `:parent` is not 'mom' or 'dad',
- `/users/mom/me/contact.html` would not match as `:id` is not a number,
- `/users/dad/123/contact` would not match as `:withHtmlExtension` is missing .html.

## Optional parameters

Parameters can be made optional by adding a `?` after the parameter name.

```jsx
<Route path="/users/:id?" component={User} />

```

With this setup, the route would match both `/users` and `/users/123`.
However, it is important to note that the `?` only makes the parameter optional for the last segment of the path.
As a result, paths beyond the optional parameter will _not_ be matched.
For instance, `/users/123/contact` would not match.

## Wildcard routes

Wildcard routes can be used to match any number of segments in a path.
To create a wildcard route, use `*` followed by the parameter name.

```jsx
<Route path="/users/*" component={User} />

```

Using an asterisk `*` as a parameter will match any number of segments after `/users`.
This includes `/users`, `/users/123`, `/users/123/contact`, and so on.

If you need to expose the wildcard segments of the path, you can name them:

```jsx
<Route path="/users/*rest" component={User} />

```

In this case, `rest` will contain the rest of the path after `/users/`.

It is important to note that wildcard routes must be located at the **end of the path**.
If you place a wildcard route before the end, such as `/users/*rest/:id`, no routes will be matched.
