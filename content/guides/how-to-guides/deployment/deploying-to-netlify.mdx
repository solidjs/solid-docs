<Title>Deploying To Netlify</Title>

Here we're going to use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to deploy our Solid.js project.

If you haven't heard of Netlify, it's a platform where developers can host their projects whether they be websites, APIs or more. For more information on Netlify and what they offer, make sure to visit their [website](https://netlify.com).

## Connecting Netlify with Your Online Git Repository

With Netlify you can make use of GitHub's continuous development actions. When connecting Netlify with your GitHub repo there's no further configuration that needs to be done in order to host and update the site on Netlify, Netlify automatically detects pushes to the branch specified and builds the project based on the commands specified in the `package.json` and the settings in the Netlify build settings. 

Here's a quick step by step guide to get your Solid.js online repo code up and running on Netlify.

**Note:** We will be making use of GitHub as an example. However, you can make use of other online git providers.

**Step 1:** Log into or sign up on Netlify using your GitHub account. You can log in or create an account [here](https://app.netlify.com).

**Step 2:** The dashboard should look similar to this once you have logged in or signed up.

Click on `Add new site` to add our new Solid.js project. 

**Step 3:** Connect your Git provider to Netlify to see a list of your repos that can be deployed to Netlify.

After selecting your Git provider and the project you want to deploy, let's setup the build settings which are located within the site settings as shown in the next step.

**Step 4:** The site settings screen should look something like this

The only setting that we need to change here is the value of `publish directory`, this needs to be changed from `netlify` to `dist` as that is where Solid.js places the final build files. 

After that just hit deploy and wait a few minutes for the site to build and you're done!

## Using the Netlify CLI

**Step 1:** Install the Netlify CLI using pnpm, yarn or npm

```bash
npm i -g netlify-cli
# or 
pnpm i -g netlify-cli
# or
yarn global add netlify-cli
```

  Before carrying out the next step make sure that you have your Netlify account setup and that you've created a team. As this will help you setup your project and deploy it.

**Step 2:** Run the `netlify init` command in your project directory and login using any of the supported login options (e.g GitHub)

```bash
netlify init
```

Follow the instructions prompted by the command line tool.

**Note:** Make sure that you set the value of the prompt `Directory to deploy (blank for current dir):` to `dist` as that is where Solid.js by default places the built project files. 

Once done answering all the prompts generated by the CLI, you should see this at the end to show that your project has been successfully configured.
