title: Security
---

As a non-opinionated framework, SolidStart doesn't enforce any security practices, though it enables enables developers to implement them as needed.
It is important to know what are the requirements for your own app and implement the fitting security measures.
If at any point you are unsure about the security of your app, or how to achieve something within the constraints of SolidStart reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/solidjs).

Below you will find a few notes on how to establish some measures.

## Security Headers

Through the use of a [middleware](/solid-start/reference/server/create-middleware#example) it is possible to tab into the `onRequest` event handlers and make sure every request going through your servers have the proper security headers set.
With this, it is possible to setup headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, among others.

### Nonces

When using `Content-Security-Policy` it is possible to use nonces to allow inline scripts and styles to be executed.
SolidStart enables that smoothly in the [`entry-server.tsx`](/solid-start/reference/entrypoints/entry-server).

By passing generating the `nonce` within a middleware and storing it in the `request.locals` object, it is possible to use it in the `entry-server.tsx` to generate the `Content-Security-Policy` header.

## Cross Request Forgery (CSRF)

There are multiple ways to add CSRF Protection to your SolidStart app.
The quickest and most common way is to check the `request.referrer` header when the HTTP method is `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE`.
This can also be achieved through an `onRequest` [middleware](/solid-start/reference/server/create-middleware#example).

## Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

SolidStart doesn't have any built-in protection against XSS attacks.
Though HTML is escapbed by default when transforming JSX, it is still reliant on other security measuers (such as `Content-Security-Policy`) to prevent XSS attacks.

Make sure to sanitize attributes (even in `<noscript>` tags) and avoid injecting HTML into your page as much as possible.
