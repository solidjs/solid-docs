<Title>Solid Router</Title>

In modern web development a router is a software component that is responsible for handling client requests and determining which component to render whether that be through server-side or client-side routing. Once a request is made on the client the router assesses the URL and decides which controller or server-side component should handle this request or be rendered.

Solid Router is a simple and easy to use universal router for Solid applications. It works both on the client and on the server. The routes are defined using a simple JSX syntax and can be nested. However, routes can also be passed as a configuration object.

Solid Router has a lot of cool features and one of those is it's ability to support nested routing which allows it to change a particular part of a component instead of replacing it completely.

It supports all of Solid's SSR methods and has Solid's transitions baked in, so use it freely with suspense, resources, and lazy components. Solid Router also allows you to define a data function that loads parallel to the routes ([render-as-you-fetch](https://epicreact.dev/render-as-you-fetch/)).

</Aside>

## Getting Started

In order to get started with Solid Router you will need to install it into your project since it is not installed by default. Once that's done we will need to setup the router and define some routes.

#### Installation

Let's jump into installing the router. To do this we will need to install the router using NPM, Yarn, or your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm install @solidjs/router
# or
yarn add @solidjs/router
# or
pnpm i @solidjs/router
```

#### Setup

Now that we have the router installed we can setup the router and define some routes. Let's start by importing the router into our root `Index` file.

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router"; // 👈 Import the router

render(
  () => (
    <Router> {/* 👈 Wrap the router around the app */}
      <App />
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

Now that we have the router setup we can define some routes. Let's start by making our `App` component our home page or `/` route.

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import { Router, Route, Routes } from "@solidjs/router";

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" component={App} /> {/* 👈 Define the home page route */}
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

In the code above we have imported the `Route` and `Routes` component from Solid Router and defined a route for the home page. The `Route` component takes a `path` prop which is the URL path that the route will match. The `component` prop is the component that will be rendered when the route is matched. The `Routes` component is used to group routes together and is required for nested routes. This component is used to show where the routes should be rendered.

You can add multiple routes under the `Routes` component and they will be rendered whenever the URL matches the route's path. Let's add a route for the `/about` and `/contact` pages.

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import About from "./About";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Router, Route, Routes } from "@solidjs/router";

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} /> {/* 👈 Define the about page route */}
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} /> {/* 👈 Define the contact page route */}
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

__Note:__ If you would like to lazy load your components so that they are only loaded when the route is matched you can use the `lazy` function from `solid-js` to lazy load your components.

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import { Router, Route, Routes } from "@solidjs/router";
import { lazy } from "solid-js";

const About = lazy(() => import("./About"));
const Contact = lazy(() => import("./Contact"));

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} /> {/* 👈 Define the about page route */}
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} /> {/* 👈 Define the contact page route */}
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

Now that we have our routes defined we can navigate to the `/about` and `/contact` pages. Let's add some links to our `App` component so we can navigate to the other pages. You can add links to your routes using the `A` component from Solid Router. Let's add links to the `/about` and `/contact` pages.

```jsx
import styles from "./App.module.css";
import { A } from "@solidjs/router"; // 👈 Import the A component

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div class={styles.App}>
      <header class={styles.header}>
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          class={styles.link}
          href="https://github.com/solidjs/solid"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn Solid
        </a>
        <A href="/about">About</A> {/* 👈 Add a link to the about page */}
        <A href="/contact">Contact</A> {/* 👈 Add a link to the contact page */}
      </header>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Creating links to other routes

#### The `A` component

The `A` component is used to create links to other routes in your application. The `A` component also takes in the `href` prop which is the URL path that the link will navigate to. The `A` component also takes in the `activeClass` prop which is the class that will be applied to the link when the current route path matches that of the link's path.

Here's a quick example of how a base Solid application with Solid Router might look, and how to use the `A` component.

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import About from "./About";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Router, Route, Routes, A } from "@solidjs/router";

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

Here's an example of how to make use of the `A` component and it's `activeClass` prop.

```jsx
import styles from "./App.css";
import { A } from "@solidjs/router";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div class={styles.App}>
      <header class={styles.header}>
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <A
          class={styles.link}
          href="/about"
          activeClass="underlined" // 👈 Add the active class
        >
          About
        </A>
        <A
          class={styles.link}
          href="/contact"
          activeClass="underlined" // 👈 Add the active class
        >
          Contact
        </A>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**Note:** Be careful when using the **`activeClass`** prop, because by default matching includes routes that are descendants or otherwise nested within the matched path (e.g. `/about` will match `/about/me` and `/about/me/you`). However, you can use the **`end`** boolean prop to match on the exact path (e.g. `/about` will only match `/about`). The **`end`** prop is particularly useful for links to the root route `/` which would match all paths.

Here's a list of all the props that the `A` component takes in.

| Prop            | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `href`          | `string`  | The path of the route to navigate to. This will be resolved relative to the route that the link is in, but you can preface it with / to refer back to the root.                          |
| `activeClass`   | `string`  | The class that will be applied to the link when the current route path matches that of the link's path.                                                                                  |
| `end`           | `boolean` | If `true`, only considers the link to be active when the curent location matches the `href` exactly; if `false`, check if the current location starts with `href`                        |
| `noScroll`      | `boolean` | If true, turn off the default behavior of scrolling to the top of the new page                                                                                                           |
| `replace`       | `boolean` | If true, don't add a new entry to the browser history. (By default, the new page will be added to the browser history, so pressing the back button will take you to the previous route.) |
| `state`         | `unknown` | [Push this value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) to the history stack when navigating                                                               |
| `inactiveClass` | `string`  | The class to show when the link is inactive (when the current location doesn't match the link)                                                                                           |

#### The `Navigate` component

Solid Router provides a `Navigate` component that works similarly to `A`, but it will immediately navigate to the provided path as soon as the component is rendered. It also uses the `href` prop, but you have the additional option of passing a function to `href` that returns a path to navigate to:

```jsx
function getPath ({navigate, location}) {
  //navigate is the result of calling useNavigate(); location is the result of calling useLocation(). 
  //You can use those to dynamically determine a path to navigate to
  return "/some-path";
}

//Navigating to /redirect will redirect you to the result of getPath
<Route path="/redirect" element={<Navigate href={getPath}/>}/>
```

## Dynamic Routes

If you don't know the path ahead of time, you might want to treat part of the path as a flexible parameter that is passed on to the component. For instance if you would like to navigate to a blog post with a particular ID you might want to use a dynamic route.

Here's a quick example of how to create a dynamic route.

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import About from "./About";
import User from "./User";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Router, Route, Routes, A } from "@solidjs/router";

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/user/:id" component={User} /> {/* 👈 Add a dynamic route */}
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

In the code snippet above we added a dynamic route named `user` that takes in a `:id` parameter. The `:id` parameter will be passed to the `User` component through the `useParams` primitive. More on Solid Router primitives later.

Here's an example of how to use the dynamic route in the `User` component.

```jsx
import styles from "./User.module.css";
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";

const User = () => {
  const params = useParams(); // 👈 Get the dynamic route parameters

  return (
    <div class={styles.User}>
      <header class={styles.header}>
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/User.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <A class={styles.link} href="/">
          Home
        </A>
        <A class={styles.link} href="/about">
          About
        </A>
        <A class={styles.link} href="/contact">
          Contact
        </A>
        <p>
          This is the user with the id of <code>{params.id}</code> {/* 👈 Access the dynamic route parameter */}
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
};

export default User;
```

You can make use of the `params` object to access the dynamic route parameters. In the example above we accessed the `id` parameter. You can make use of the parameters even in primitives like `createResource` and `createSignal`:

Here's an example of what this might look like in a `createResource` primitive:

```jsx
import { createResource, createSignal } from "solid-js";
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";

// 👇 This is an asynchronous function that fetches a user from the jsonplaceholder API
async function fetchUser(id) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${id}`);
  return response.json();
}

const User = () => {
  const params = useParams();
  const [data] = createResource(params.id,fetchUser) // 👈 Pass the dynamic route parameter to the createResource primitive

  return (
    <div>
      {data.loading ? ( // 👈 Use the loading property to show a loading indicator
        <p>Loading...</p>
      ) : (
        <div>
          <p>Name: {data().name}</p> {/* 👈 Access the data returned from the fetchUser function */}
          <p>Email: {data().email}</p>
          <p>Phone: {data().phone}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default User;
```

In the above code snippet we passed the `id` parameter to the `createResource` primitive. This means that the `fetchUser` function will be called every time the `id` parameter changes. This is useful if you want to fetch new user data every time the `id` parameter changes.

#### Optional Parameters

You can also make a parameter optional by adding a `?` after the parameter name. For example, if you want to make the `id` parameter optional you can do the following:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import About from "./About";
import User from "./User";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Router, Route, Routes, A } from "@solidjs/router";

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/user/:id?" component={User} /> {/* 👈 Make the id parameter optional */}
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

The optional `/user/:id?` route will match `/user` and `/user/123` but not `/user/123/comment`.

#### Wildcard Routes/Parameters

Wildcard routes are routes that match any descendant path within a given path.

You can also make a parameter a wildcard by adding a `*` after the parameter name. For example, if you want to make the `id` parameter a wildcard you can do the following:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import About from "./About";
import User from "./User";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Router, Route, Routes, A } from "@solidjs/router";

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/user/*" component={User} /> {/* 👈 Make the id parameter a wildcard */}
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

The wildcard `/user/*` route will match `/user`, `/user/123`, `/user/123/comment`, `/user/123/comment/456`, etc.

If you would like to access the wildcard parameter you can name it:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./App";
import About from "./About";
import User from "./User";
import Contact from "./Contact";
import { Router, Route, Routes, A } from "@solidjs/router";

render(
  () => (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" component={App} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/user/*id" component={User} /> {/* 👈 Name the wildcard parameter */}
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  ),
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

You can access the wildcard parameter the same way you would access a dynamic route parameter:

```jsx
import styles from "./User.module.css";
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";

const User = () => {
  const params = useParams(); // 👈 Get the wildcard route parameters

  return (
    <div class={styles.User}>
      <header class={styles.header}>
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/User.tsx</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <A class={styles.link} href="/">
          Home
        </A>
        <A class={styles.link} href="/about">
          About
        </A>
        <A class={styles.link} href="/contact">
          Contact
        </A>
        <p>
          This is the wildcard parameter <code>{params.id}</code> {/* 👈 Access the wildcard parameter */}
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
};

export default User;
```

__Note:__ The wildcard token `*` must be the last token in the route path. For instance `/user/*id` is valid but `/user/id*` and `/user/*id/foo` is not.

#### Multiple Paths

Routes also support defining multiple paths using an array. This allows a route to remain mounted and not rerender when switching between two or more locations that it matches:

```jsx
//Navigating from login to register does not cause the Login component to re-render
<Route path={["login", "register"]} component={Login}/>
```

## Data Functions

In the previous examples, the User component is lazy-loaded and then the data is fetched. With route data functions, we can instead start fetching the data parallel to loading the route, so we can use the data as soon as possible.

To do this, create a function that fetches and returns the data using `createResource`. Then pass that function to the `data` prop of the `Route` component.

<CodeTabs
  js={[{name: "example.jsx", component: dataFunctionSnippet1JS}]}
  ts={[{name: "example.tsx", component: dataFunctionSnippet1TS}]}
/>

The `data` function will be called once the route is loaded and the result can be accessed by calling `useRouteData` in the route component.

<CodeTabs js={[{name:"/pages/users/[id].jsx", component: routeDataSnippetJS}]} ts={[{name: "/pages/users/[id].tsx", component: routeDataSnippetTS}]}/>

As the data function only has one argument which is an object that contains route information such as 

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `params` | object | The route parameters (same value as calling useParams() inside the route component) |
| `location` | `{ pathname, search, hash, query, state, key}` | An object that you can use to get more information about the path (corresponds to [useLocation()](#uselocation)) |
| `navigate` | `(to: string, options?: NavigateOptions) => void` | A function that you can call to navigate to a different route instead (corresponds to [useNavigate()](#usenavigation)) |
| `data` | unknown | The data returned by the parent's data function, if any. (Data will pass through any intermediate nesting.) |

A common pattern is to export the data function that corresponds to a route in a dedicated `route.data.js|ts` file. This way, the data function can be imported without loading anything else.

```diff 
  import { lazy } from "solid-js";
  import { Route } from "@solidjs/router";
- import { fetchUser } ... 
+ import UserData from "./pages/users/[id].data.js";
  const User = lazy(() => import("/pages/users/[id].js"));

  // In the Route definition
  <Route path="/users/:id" component={User} data={UserData} />;
```

There's no need for the fetchUser function to be imported anymore since it is no longer being used here but in the `[id].data.js` file.

## Nested Routes

Nested routes are another way of defining your routes. They are useful when you have a lot of routes and want to group them together. They also allow you to define a layout component that will be used for all the nested routes.

Here's a quick code example showing the difference between normal route definitions and nested route definitions:

```jsx
<Route path="/users/:id" component={User} />  {/*// Normal route definition */}
```

```jsx
<Routes path="/users">
  <Route path="/:id" component={User} /> {/*// Nested route definition */}
</Route>
```

`/users/:id` renders the `<User/>` component, and `/users/` is an empty route.

Only leaf Route nodes (innermost `Route` components) are given a route. If you want to make the parent its own route, you have to specify it separately:

```jsx
//This won't work the way you'd expect
<Route path="/users" component={Users}>
  <Route path="/:id" component={User} />
</Route>

//This works
<Route path="/users" component={Users} />
<Route path="/users/:id" component={User} />

//This also works
<Route path="/users">
  <Route path="/" component={Users} />
  <Route path="/:id" component={User} />
</Route>
```

The first Nested Route definition will not work as you would expect it to because it works in a completely different way which makes use of an `<Outlet/>` component. The `<Outlet/>` component is used to render the child routes of a parent route. The `<Outlet/>` component is only rendered when the parent route is active. This means that the `<User/>` component will only be rendered when the `/users/:id` route is active. Here's what that looks like:

```jsx

import { Outlet } from "@solidjs/router";

function PageWrapper () {
  return <div>
    <h1> We love our users! </h1>
    <Outlet/>
    <A href="/">Back Home</A>
  </div>
}

<Route path="/users" component={PageWrapper}>
  <Route path="/" component={Users}/>
  <Route path="/:id" component={User} />
</Route>
```

The routes are still configured the same, but now the route elements will appear inside the parent element where the `<Outlet/>` was declared.

You can nest indefinitely - just remember that only leaf nodes will become their own routes. In this example, the only route created is `/layer1/layer2`, and it appears as three nested divs.

```jsx 
<Route path='/' element={<div>Onion starts here <Outlet /></div>}>
  <Route path='layer1' element={<div>Another layer <Outlet /></div>}>
    <Route path='layer2' element={<div>Innermost layer</div>}></Route>
  </Route>
</Route>
```

If you declare a data function on a parent and a child, the result of the parent's data function will be passed to the child's data function as the `data` property of the argument, as described in the last section. This works even if it isn't a direct child, because by default every route forwards its parent's data.

## Hash Mode Router

By default, Solid Router uses `location.pathname` as route path. You can simply switch to hash mode through the `source` property on `<Router>` component.

```jsx
import { Router, hashIntegration } from '@solidjs/router'

<Router source={hashIntegration()}>
  <App />
</Router>
```

<Aside>Todo: Add link to article on hash mode</Aside>

## Config Based Routing

You don't have to use JSX to define your routes. You can also use a config object to define your routes. This is useful when you want to define your routes in a separate file and import them into your app, then pass them to `useRoutes`.

```jsx 
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, useRoutes, A } from "@solidjs/router";

// Define your routes
const routes = [
  {
    path: "/users",
    component: lazy(() => import("/pages/users.js"))
  },
  {

## Router Primitives 

Solid Router provides a number of primitives that read off the Router and Route context.

### `useParams`

Retrieves a reactive, store-like object containing the current route path parameters as defined in the Route.

```jsx
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";

const params = useParams();

// fetch user based on the id path parameter
const [user] = createResource(() => params.id, fetchUser);
```

### `useNavigation`

This retrieves a method to do navigation imperatively. It returns a `navigate` function that takes a path and an optional options object. The options object can contain a `replace` property to replace the current history entry instead of pushing a new one.

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();

if (unauthorized) {
  navigate("/login", { replace: true });
}
```

Here's a list of the available options:

- resolve (_boolean_, default `true`): resolve the path against the current route
- replace (_boolean_, default `false`): replace the history entry
- scroll (_boolean_, default `true`): scroll to top after navigation
- state (_any_, default `undefined`): pass custom state to location.state

<Aside>
  Note: The state is serialized using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm">structured clone algorithm</a> which does not support all object types.

### `useLocation`

Retrieves reactive `location` object useful for getting things like `pathname`, `search`, `hash`, `state`, etc.

```jsx
import { useLocation } from "@solidjs/router";

const location = useLocation();

const pathname = createMemo(() => location.pathname);
```

### `useSearchParams`

Retrieves a tuple containing a reactive object to read the current location's query parameters and a method to update them. The object is a proxy so you must access properties to subscribe to reactive updates. Note values will be strings and property names will retain their casing.

The setter method accepts an object whose entries will be merged into the current query string. Values like `''`, `undefined` and `null` will remove the key from the resulting query string. Updates will behave just like a navigation and the setter accepts the same optional second parameter as `navigate` and auto-scrolling is disabled by default.

```jsx 
const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();

return (
  <div>
    <span>Page: {searchParams.page}</span>
    <button onClick={() => setSearchParams({ page: searchParams.page + 1 })}>Next Page</button>
  </div>
);
```

### `useIsRouting`

Retrieves signal that indicates whether the route is currently in a Transition. Useful for showing stale/pending state when the route resolution is Suspended during concurrent rendering.

```jsx 
const isRouting = useIsRouting();

return (
  <div classList={{ "grey-out": isRouting() }}>
    <MyAwesomeContent />
  </div>
);
```

### `useRouteData`

Retrieves the return value from the [data function](#data-functions).

<CodeTabs js={[{name:"app.jsx", component: routeDataSnippetJS}]} ts={[{name: "app.tsx", component: routeDataSnippetTS}]}/>

### `useMatch`

`useMatch` takes an accessor that returns the path and creates a Memo that returns match information if the current path matches the provided path. Useful for determining if a given path matches the current route.

```jsx 
const match = useMatch(() => props.href);

return <div classList={{ active: Boolean(match()) }} />;
```

### `useRoutes`

Used to define routes via a config object instead of JSX. See [Config Based Routing](#config-based-routing).

### `useBeforeLeave`

`useBeforeLeave` takes a function that will be called prior to leaving a route. The function will be called with:

- from (`Location`): current location (before change).
- to (`string | number`): path passed to navigate.
- options (`NavigateOptions`): options passed to navigate.
- preventDefault (void function): call to block the route change.
- defaultPrevented (readonly boolean): true if any previously called leave handlers called preventDefault().
- retry (void function, force?: boolean ): call to retry the same navigation, perhaps after confirming with the user. Pass true to skip running the leave handlers again (ie force navigate without confirming).

Example usage: 

```jsx
useBeforeLeave((e: BeforeLeaveEventArgs) => {
  if (form.isDirty && !e.defaultPrevented) {
    // preventDefault to block immediately and prompt user async
    e.preventDefault();
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (window.confirm("Discard unsaved changes - are you sure?")) {
        // user wants to proceed anyway so retry with force=true
        e.retry(true); 
      }
    }, 100);
  }
});
```
