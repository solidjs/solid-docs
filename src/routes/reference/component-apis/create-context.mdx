Context provides a form of dependency injection in Solid. 
It is used to save from needing to pass data as props through intermediate components (aka** prop drilling**).
This function creates a new context object that can be used with [useContext](/reference/component-apis/use-context) and offers the Provider control flow.
Default Context is used when no Provider is found above in the hierarchy.

## Usage

To avoid reinstatiating a new context when Hot-Module Replacement (HMR) occurs, it is recommended to use `createContext` in its own module (file).

<Callout type="danger" title="Hot-Module Replacement">
When using HMR, the context is lost when the module is reloaded. Which will cause an error to be thrown as `useContext` will try to access it while it is still reloading.
</Callout>


For example:

```ts title="/context/counter.ts"
import { createContext } from "solid-js";

export const DEFAULT_COUNT = 0
const INTIAL_STORE_SETTER = {
	increment: () => void,
	decrement: () => void
};

export const CounterContext = createContext([
	{ count: INITIAL_COUNT },
	INTIAL_STORE_SETTER
]);
```

With the context created in its own module, you can use to instantiate the context provider.

```ts title="/context/counter-component.tsx"
import { createStore } from 'solid-js/store';
import { CounterContext, DEFAULT_COUNT } from "./counter.ts";

export function CounterProvider(props) {
    const [value, setValue] = createStore({ count: props.initialCount || DEFAULT_COUNT })
    
	const counter = [
        value,
        {
            increment() {
                setValue("count", currentCount => currentCount + 1)
            },
            decrement() {
                setValue("count", currentcount => currentCount - 1)
            },
        },
    ]

    return (
        <CounterContext.Provider value={counter}>
            {props.children}
        </CounterContext.Provider>
    )
}
```

A few imporant notes on how to pass data through the context API:

- The value passed to provider is passed to `useContext` as is. 
- Wrapping as a reactive expression will not work. 
- You should pass in Signals and Stores directly instead of accessing them in the JSX.

To learn how to consume the context, see the [useContext](/reference/component-apis/use-context) documentation and the [Context concepts entry](/concepts/context).

## Default Values

`createContext()` takes an optional "default value" as an argument. 
If `useContext` is called and there is no corresponding context provider above it in the component hierarchy, then the value passed as `defaultValue` is returned.

However, if no `defaultValue` was passed, then `undefined` is returned in this case. 
Also, `defaultValue` (or `undefined`) is returned if `useContext` is called inside an event callback, as it is then outside of the component hierarchy.

This has implications for TS. 
If no `defaultValue` is passed, then it is possible that `useContext()` will return `undefined`, and the types reflect this.

Another (used in the example in the previous section) is provide a default value to `createContext()`. 
In that case, `useContext()` will always return a value, and therefore TS will not complain either. 
The pitfall with this approach is that if you _unintentionally_ use `useContext` outside of a provider, it may not be immediately apparent, because the context is still providing a valid value. 
Therefore, if you expect to always use `useContext` within a provider, it is best to use the error based approach described above.

## Type signature

```ts
interface Context<T> {
	id: symbol
	Provider: (props: { value: T; children: any }) => any
	defaultValue: T
}

function createContext<T>(defaultValue?: T): Context<T | undefined>
```
