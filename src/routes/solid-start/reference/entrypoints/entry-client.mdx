`entry-client.tsx` is where an application starts in the browser. 
It does this by passing [`<StartClient>`](/solid-start/reference/client/start-client) and a DOM Element (the mounting point), to the [`mount`](/solid-start/reference/client/mount) function.

```tsx
import { mount, StartClient } from "@solidjs/start/client";

mount(() => <StartClient />, document.getElementById("app")!);
```

This file is an ideal place to run any client specific code that is needed on startup, such as registering service workers. 
This is important if you are performing client-only rendering or using other modes of server-side rendering.
