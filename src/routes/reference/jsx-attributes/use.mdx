These are custom directives. In a sense this is just syntax sugar over ref but allows us to easily attach multiple directives to a single element. A directive is a function with the following signature:

```ts
function directive(element: Element, accessor: () => any): void
```

Directive functions are called at render time but before being added to the DOM. You can do whatever you'd like in them including create signals, effects, register clean-up etc.

```tsx
const [name, setName] = createSignal("")

function model(el, value) {
	const [field, setField] = value()
	createRenderEffect(() => (el.value = field()))
	el.addEventListener("input", (e) => setField(e.target.value))
}

;<input type="text" use:model={[name, setName]} />
```

To register with TypeScript extend the JSX namespace.

```ts
declare module "solid-js" {
	namespace JSX {
		interface Directives {
			model: [() => any, (v: any) => any]
		}
	}
}
```
