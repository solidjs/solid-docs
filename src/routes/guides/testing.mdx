Testing your Solid applications is important to inspiring confidence in your codebase through preventing regressions.

## Getting started

### Testing packages explanations

- [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev) - testing framework that includes runner, assertion engine, and mocking facilities
- [`jsdom`](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) - a virtual DOM used to simulate a headless browser environment running in node
- [`@solidjs/testing-library`](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-testing-library/blob/main/README.md) - a library to simplify testing components, directives, and primitives, with automatic cleanup
- [`@testing-library/user-event`](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro) - used to simulate user events that are closer to reality
- [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom) - augments expect with helpful matchers


### Adding testing packages

The recommended testing testing framework for Solid applications is [vitest](https://vitest.dev). 

To get started with vitest, install the following development dependencies:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
  <div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm i -D vitest jsdom @solidjs/testing-library @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
```
  </div>
  <div id="yarn">
```bash frame="none"
yarn add -D vitest jsdom @solidjs/testing-library @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
```
  </div>
  <div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm i -D vitest jsdom @solidjs/testing-library @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
```
  </div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

### Testing configuration

In your `package.json` add a `test` script calling `vitest`:

```json title="package.json"
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest"
  }
```

It is not necessary to add `@testing-library/jest-dom` to the testing options in `vite.config`, since `vite-plugin-solid` automatically detects and loads it if present.

#### TypeScript configuration

If using TypeScript, add `@testing-library/jest-dom` to `tsconfig.json#compilerOptions.types`:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "jsxImportSource": "solid-js",
    "types": ["vite/client", "@testing-library/jest-dom"]
  }
```

#### SolidStart configuration

When using [SolidStart](/solid-start), create a `vitest.config.ts` file:

```ts title="vitest.config.ts"
import solid from "vite-plugin-solid"
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config"

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [solid()],
  resolve: {
    conditions: ["development", "browser"],
  },
})
```

## Writing tests

### Components testing

Testing components involves three main things:

- Rendering the component
- Interacting with the component
- Validating assertions

To write tests for your components, create a `[name].test.tsx` file.
The purpose of this file is to describe the intended behavior from a user's perspective in the form of unit tests:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="Counter.test.jsx">
```jsx frame="none"
import { test, expect } from "vitest"
import { render } from "@solidjs/testing-library"
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event"
import { Counter } from './Counter'

const user = userEvent.setup()

test("increments value", async () => {
  const { getByRole } = render(() => <Counter />)
  const counter = getByRole('button')
  expect(counter).toHaveTextContent("1")
  await user.click(counter)
  expect(counter).toHaveTextContent("2")
})
```
</div>
<div id="Counter.jsx">
```jsx frame="none"
export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = createSignal(1);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count() + 1)}>
      {count()}
    </button>
  );
}
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

In the `test.jsx` file, [the `render` call from `@solidjs/testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/solid-testing-library/api#render) is used to render the component and supply the props and context.
To mimic a user interaction, `@testing-library/user-event` is used.
The [`expect` function provided by `vitest`](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html) is extended with a [`.ToHaveTextContent("content")` matcher from `@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file#tohavetextcontent) to supply what the expected behavior is for this component.

To run this test, use the following command:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
  <div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm test
```
  </div>
  <div id="yarn">
```bash frame="none"
yarn test
```
  </div>
  <div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm test
```
  </div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

If running the command is successful, you will get the following result showing whether the tests have passed or failed:

```ansi frame="none"

```

#### Rendering the component

The  `render` function from `@solidjs/testing-library` creates the testing environment within the `test.tsx` file.
It sets up the container, rendering the component within it, and automatically registers it for clean-up after a successful test.
Additionally, it manages wrapping the component in contexts as well as setting up a router.

```tsx frame="none"
const renderResult = render(
  () => <MyComponent />, // @solidjs/testing-library requires a function
  { // all options are optional
    container, // manually set up your own container, will not be handled
    baseElement, // parent of container in case it is not supplied
    queries, // manually set up custom queries
    hydrate, // set to `true` to use hydration
    wrapper, // reusable wrapper component to supply context
    location, // sets up a router pointed to the location if provided
  }
)
const {
  asFragment, // function returning the contents of the container
  baseElement, // the parent of the container
  container, // the container in which the component is rendered
  debug, // a function giving some helpful debugging output
  unmount, // manually removing the component from the container
  ...queries, // functions to select elements from the container
} = renderResult
```

##### Using the right queries

Queries are helpers used to find elements within a page.

```
                                          âŽ§ Role
                              get âŽ«  By   âŽª DisplayValue
                            query âŽ¬       âŽ¨ LabelText
                             find âŽ­ AllBy âŽª Text
                                          âŽ© ...
```

The prefixes (`get`, `query`, and `find`) and the middle portion (`By` and `AllBy`) depend on if the query should wait for an element to appear (or not), whether it should throw an error if the element cannot be found, and how it should handle multiple matches:

- **getBy**: synchronous, throws if not found or more than 1 matches
- **getAllBy**: synchronous, throws if not found, returns array of matches
- **queryBy**: synchronous, null if not found, error if more than 1 matches
- **queryAllBy**: synchronous, returns array of zero or more matches
- **findBy**: asynchronous, rejected if not found within 1000ms or more than 1 matches, resolves wth element if found
- **findAllBy**: asynchronous, rejected if not found within 1000ms, resolves with array of one or more element(s)

By default, queries should start with `get...`. 
If there are multiple elements matching the same query, `getAllBy...` should be used, otherwise use `getBy...`.

There are two exceptions when you should **not** start with `get...`:

1. If the `location` option is used or the component is based on resources, the router will be lazy-loaded; in this case, the first query after rendering needs to be `find...`
2. When testing something that is *not* rendered, you will need to find something that will be rendered at the same time; after that, use `queryAllBy...` to test if the result is an empty array (`[]`).

The query's suffix (Role, LabelText, ...) depends on the characteristics of the element you want to select.
If possible, try to select for accessible attributes (roughly in the following order):

- **Role**: [WAI ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria) landmark roles which are automatically set by semantic elements like `<button>` or otherwise use `role` attribute
- **LabelText**: elements that are described by a label wrapping the element, or by an `aria-label` attribute, or is linked with `for`- or `aria-labelledby` attribute
- **PlaceholderText**: input elements with a `placeholder` attribute
- **Text**: searches text within all text nodes in the element, even if split over multiple nodes
- **DisplayValue**: form elements showing the given value (e.g. select elements)
- **AltText**: images with alt text
- **Title**: HTML elements with the `title` attribute or SVGs with the `<title>` tag containing the given text
- **TestId**: queries by the `data-testid` attribute; a different data attribute can be setup via `configure({testIdAttribute: 'data-my-test-attribute'})`; TestId-queries are *not accessible*, so use them only as a last resort.

For more information, check the [testing-library documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about).

#### Testing through Portal

Solid allows components to break through the DOM tree structure using [`<Portal>`](/reference/components/portal). This mechanism will still work in testing, so the content of the portals will break out of the testing container. In order to test this content, make sure to use the `screen` export to query the contents:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="Toast.test.jsx">
```jsx frame="none"
import { test, expect } from "vitest"
import { render, screen } from "@solidjs/testing-library"
import { Toast } from './Toast'

test("increments value", async () => {
  render(() => <Toast><p>This is a toast</p></Toast>)
  const toast = screen.getByRole("log")
  expect(toast).toHaveTextContent("This is a toast")
})
```
</div>
<div id="Toast.jsx">
```jsx frame="none"
import { Portal } from "solid-js/web";

export const Toast = (props) => {
  return (
    <Portal>
      <div class="toast" role={props.role ?? "log"}>
        {props.children}
      </div>
    </Portal>
  );
}
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

#### Testing in context

If a component relies on some context, to wrap it use the `wrapper` option:

```tsx title="Context.test.tsx"
import { test, expect } from "vitest"
import { render } from "@solidjs/testing-library"
import { DataContext, DataConsumer } from "./Data"

const wrapper = (props) => <DataContext value="test" {...props} />

test("receives data from context", () => {
  const { getByText } = render(() => <DataConsumer />, { wrapper })
  expect(getByText("test")).toBeInTheDocument()
});
```

Wrappers can be re-used if they are created externally.
For wrappers with different values, a higher-order component creating the required wrappers can make the tests more concise:

```tsx
const createWrapper = (value) => (props) => 
  <DataContext value={value} {...props}/>
```

<Callout title="Using multiple providers">
If using multiple providers, [solid-primitives has `<MultiProvider>`](https://primitives.solidjs.community/package/context#multiprovider) to avoid nesting multiple levels of providers
</Callout>

##### Testing routes

For convenience, the `render` function supports the `location` option that wraps the rendered component in a router pointing at the given location.
Since the `<Router>` component is lazily loaded, the first query after rendering needs to be asynchronous, i.e. `findBy...`:

```tsx
const { findByText } = render(
  () => <Route path="/article/:id" component={Article} />,
  { location: "/article/12345" }
);
expect(await findByText("Article 12345")).toBeInTheDocument()
```

#### Interacting with components

Many components are not static, rather they change based on user interactions.
To test these changes, these interactions need to be simulated.
To simulate user interactions, `@testing-library/user-event` library can be used.
It takes care of the usual order of events as they would occur in actual user interactions.
For example, this means that a `click` event from the user would be accompanied by `mousemove`, `hover`, `keydown`, `focus`, `keyup`, and `keypress`.

The most convenient events to test are typically `click`, `keyboard` and `pointer` (to simulate touch events). 
To dive deeper into these events, you can learn about them in the [`user-event` documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro).


##### Using timers

If you require a fake timer and want to use `vi.useFakeTimers()` in your tests, it must set it up with an `advanceTimers` option:

```tsx title="user-event.test.tsx"
import { vi } from "vitest"

const user = userEvent.setup({ advanceTimers: vi.advanceTimersByTime })

vi.useFakeTimers()

describe("pre-login: sign-in", () => {
  const { getByRole, getByLabelText } = render(() => <User />)
  const signUp = getByRole('button', { text: 'Sign-in' })
  // use convenience API click:
  user.click(signUp)
  const name = getByLabelText('Name')
  // use complex keyboard input:
  user.keyboard(name, "{Shift}test{Space}{Shift}user")
  const password = getByLabelText('Password')
  user.keyboard(name, "secret")
  const login = getByRole('button', { text: 'Login' })
  // use touch event
  user.pointer([
    { keys: "[TouchA]" target: login },
    { keys: "[/TouchA]", target: login }
  ])
});
```

#### Validating assertions

`vitest` comes with the `expect` function to facilitate assertions that works like:

```tsx frame="none"
expect(subject)[assertion](value)
```

The command supports assertions like `toBe` (reference comparison) and `toEqual` (value comparison) out of the box.
For testing inside the DOM, the package `@testing-library/jest-dom` augments it with some helpful additional assertions:

- [`.toBeInTheDocument()`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file#tobeinthedocument) - checks if the element actually exists in the DOM
- [`.toBeVisible()`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file#tobevisible) - checks if there is no reason the element should be hidden
- [`.toHaveTextContent(content)`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file#tohavetextcontent) - checks if the text content matches
- [`.toHaveFocus()`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file#tohavefocus) - checks if this is the currently focused element
- [`.toHaveAccessibleDescription(description)`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file#tohaveaccessibledescription) - checks accessible description
- and a [lot more](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-matchers).


### Directive testing

[Directives](/reference/jsx-attributes/use) are reusable behaviors for elements.
They receive the HTML element they are bound to as their first and an accessor of the directive prop as their second argument.
To make testing them more concise, [`@solidjs/testing-library` has a `renderDirective`](https://testing-library.com/docs/solid-testing-library/api#renderdirective) function:


```ts frame="none"
const renderResult = renderDirective(directive, {
  initialValue, // value initially added to the argument signal
  targetElement, // opt. node name or element used as target for the directive
  ...renderOptions, // see render options
})
const {
  arg, // getter for the directive's argument
  setArg, // setter for the directive's argument
  ...renderResults, // see render results
} = renderResult
```

In `...renderResults`, the container will contain the `targetElement`, which defaults to a `<div>`.
This, along with the ability to modify the `arg` signal, are helpful when testing directives.

If, for example, you have a directive that handles the [Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API), you can test it like this:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
  <div id="fullscreen.test.ts">
```ts frame="none"
import { test, expect, vi } from "vitest"
import { renderDirective } from "@solidjs/testing-library"
import { createFullScreen } from "./fullscreen"

test("toggles fullscreen", () => {
  const targetElement = document.createElement("div")
  const fs = vi.spyOn(targetElement, "fullscreen")
  const [setArg, container] = renderDirective(createFullScreen, false)
  setArg(true)
  expect(fs).toHaveBeenCalled()
})
```
  </div>
  <div id="fullscreen.ts">
```ts frame="none"
import { Accessor } from "solid-js"

export const fullscreen = (ref: HTMLElement, active: Accessor<boolean>) =>
  createEffect(() => {
    const isActive = document.fullscreenElement === ref
    if (active() && !isActive) {
      ref.requestFullScreen().catch(() => {})
    } else if (!active() && isActive) {
      document.exitFullScreen()
    }
  })
```
  </div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

### Primitive testing

When the reference to an element is not needed, parts of state and logic can be put into reusable hooks or primitives. 
Since these do not require elements, there is no need for `render` to test them since it would require a component that has no other use.
To avoid this, there is a [`renderHook` utility](https://testing-library.com/docs/solid-testing-library/api#renderhook) that simulates a component without actually rendering anything.

```ts frame="none"
const renderResult = renderHook(hook, {
  initialProps, // an array with arguments being supplied to the hook
  wrapper, // same as the wrapper optionss for `render`
})
const {
  result, // return value of the hook (mutable, destructuring fixes it)
  cleanup, // manually remove the traces of the test from the DOM
  owner, // the owner running the hook to use with `runWithOwner()` 
} = renderResult
```

A primitive that manages the state of a counter could be tested like this:

```ts frame="none"
import { test, expect } from "vitest"
import { renderHook } from "@solidjs/testing-library"
import { createCounter } from "./counter"

test("increments count", () => {
  const { result } = renderHook(createCounter)
  expect(result.count).toBe(0)
  result.increment()
  expect(result.count).toBe(1)
})
```


### Testing effects

Since effects may happen asynchronously, it can be difficult to test them. 
[`@solidjs/testing-library` comes with a `testEffect` function](https://testing-library.com/docs/solid-testing-library/api#async-methods) that takes another function that receives a `done` function to be called once tests are over and returns a promise.
Once `done` is called, the returned promise is resolved.
Any errors that would hit the next boundary are used to reject the returned promise.

An example test using `testEffect` may look like this:

```ts frame="none"
const [value, setValue] = createSignal(0)
return testEffect(done =>
  createEffect((run: number = 0) => {
    if (run === 0) {
      expect(value()).toBe(0)
      setValue(1)
    } else if (run === 1) {
      expect(value()).toBe(1)
      done()
    }
    return run + 1
  })
)
```


### Integration/E2E testing

Some issues can only be found once the code is running in the environment it is supposed to run in. 
Since integration and end-to-end tests are agnostic to frameworks, all proven approaches will work equally for Solid.
