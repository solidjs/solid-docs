# Overview

SolidStart is an open source, meta-framework that provides the platform to put components that comprise a web application together.
It is built on top of [SolidJS](/) and uses [Vinxi](https://vinxi.vercel.app/), an agnostic Framework Bundler that combines the power of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/).

Start avoids being opinionated by only providing the fewest amount of pieces to get you started.
While templates are available that include many of the expected tools, SolidStart itself does not ship with a Router or Metadata library.
Rather, it leaves that open for you to use any library you want.

SolidStart provides you the ability to render your applications in different ways depending on what is best for your use case.
These include:

- Client-side rendering (CSR)
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)

A driving principle of SolidStart is that code should be _isomorphic_ &mdash; this ensures that code can be written once and executed correctly whether on the client or server.

## Features

SolidStart features the following capabilities:

- **Fine-grained reactivity** &mdash; Powered by SolidJS and it's fine-grained reactivity.
- **Isomorphic, nested routing** &mdash; The same routes are rendered regardless of whether the page is on the client or server.
  Route nesting provides parent-child relationships that simplify application logic.
- **Multiple rendering modes** &mdash; Can be used to create CSR, SSR (Sync, Async and Streaming), and SSG applications.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI) and templates** &mdash; Provides a CLI and templates to help you get started quickly.
- **Deployment presets** &mdash; Provides presets to support deployment to multiple platforms including Netlify, Vercel, AWS, and Cloudflare.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using SolidStart, you should have a basic understanding of web development.
This includes knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
With SolidStart being a SolidJS meta-framework, we recommend knowing SolidJS prior to digging in to these docs (or at least [taking the SolidJS tutorial](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial)).

## SolidStart 1.0 is coming soon!

SolidStart 1.0 is on the way and we are excited to share it with you soon.

We are working hard to make sure that the APIs are stable and that the framework is ready for production use.
We are also working on improving the documentation and adding more examples to help you get started.
Over the next few weeks, we will be adding more content to the documentation and improving the overall experience of using SolidStart to get ready for the 1.0 release.

If you experience any issues while using SolidStart, please let us know by [opening an issue in the SolidStart Repo](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/issues).
Additionally, if you notice any issues or feel that something is missing in the documentation, please let us know in the [Solid Docs Repo](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/issues).
