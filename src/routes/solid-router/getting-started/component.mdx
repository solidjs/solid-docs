title: "Component routing"

In Solid Router, routes can be defined directly in an application's template using JSX.
This is the most common way to define routes in Solid Router.

To define routes using JSX, the [`Route`](/solid-router/reference/components/route) is added to the [`<Router>`](/solid-router/reference/components/router) component for each path you want to define:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

import HomePage from "./routes/Home";

render(
    () => (
        <Router>
            <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
        </Router>
    ),
    document.getElementById("app")
);
```

The Route component takes a `path` prop, which is the path to match, and a `component` prop, where you pass the component (or element) to render when the path matches.
In the example above, the `HomePage` component is rendered when the user navigates to the root path `/`.

To apply multiple routes to the router, add additional `Route` components to the `Router`:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

import HomePage from "./routes/index.jsx";
import AboutPage from "./routes/about.jsx";

render(
    () => (
        <Router>
            <Route path="/" component={HomePage} />
            <Route path="/hello-world" component={() => <h1>Hello World!</h1>} />
            <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
        </Router>
    ),
    document.getElementById("app")
);
```

This example defines three routes: the root path (`/`) which renders the `HomePage` component, the path `/hello-world` which renders an `h1` element, and the path `/about` which renders the `AboutPage` component.
