title: HashRouter
---

The `HashRouter` is a top-level component that manages the routing of your application. It is a client-side router that uses the hash portion of the URL, allowing a single-page application to mimic the experience of a multi-page site.

Hash routing enables an application to run from a single HTML file, making it suitable for hosting on static file servers.

However, compared to a browser router like [`Router`](/solid-router/reference/components/router), this approach is not SEO-friendly. Most search engines do not index the hash portion of URLs, so they can only crawl the index page of your application.

The `root` prop is used for layout components that wrap matched routes and need access to the router context. This is particularly useful for navigation components that include [`<A>`](/solid-router/reference/components/a) links.

```tsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { HashRouter, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

const App = (props) => (
	<>
		<h1>Root header</h1>
		{props.children}
	</>
);

render(
	() => <HashRouter root={App}>{/*... routes */}</HashRouter>,
	document.getElementById("app")
);
```
