Redirects to the next route.
When done over a server RPC (Remote Procedure Call), the redirect will be done through the server.
By default the status code of a `redirect()` is `302 - FOUND`, also known as a temporary redirect.

Other useful redirect codes:

| Code | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `301` | Moved Permanently |
| `307` | Temporary Redirect |
| `308` | Permanent redirect |

:::tip[Redirect Methods]
307 and 308 won't allow the browser to change the method of the request.
If you want to change the method, you should use 301 or 302.
:::

A common use-case for throwing a redirect is when a user is not authenticated and needs to be sent to the login page or another public route.

```js title="/queries/get-user.ts" {7}
import { query, redirect } from "@solidjs/router";
import { getCurrentUser } from "../auth";

const getUser = query(() => {
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  
  if (!user) throw redirect("/login");
  
  return user;
}, "get-user")
```

## Single-Flight Mutations

When using `redirect` during a Server Action, the redirect will be done through the server.
The response value will automatically send data for the destination route, avoiding a subsequent roundtrip to load the data from the target route.

This is useful when redirecting the user to a different route once a mutation is done.

```ts title="/actions/add-user.ts" {3,6}
import { action, redirect } from "@solidjs/router";

const addUser = action(async (user: User) => {
  await postUser(user);
  
  return redirect("/users");
});
```

The `addUser` action will redirect the user to the `/users` route once the user has been added to the database.
The response from the form action will send the updated data for the `/users` route without the developer needing to revalidate or reload.

## Throw vs Return

Both `throw` and `return` can be used to redirect the user to a different route.
For general usage `throw` is recommended as it immediately stops the execution of the current action and redirects the user.

When returning from a nested method, the parent method will continue to execute, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

### TypeScript Signature

```typescript
type RouterResponseInit = Omit<ResponseInit, "body"> & {
  revalidate?: string | string[];
};

function redirect(url: string, init?: number | RouterResponseInit): CustomResponse<never>;
``` 

The `ResponseOptions` type extends the native [`ResponseInit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/Response#options) interface.
