title: createResource
---

This creates a signal that returns the result of an async request.

```ts
type ResourceReturn<T> = [
	{
		(): T | undefined
		state: "unresolved" | "pending" | "ready" | "refreshing" | "errored"
		loading: boolean
		error: any
		latest: T | undefined
	},
	{
		mutate: (v: T | undefined) => T | undefined
		refetch: (info: unknown) => Promise<T> | T
	}
]

export type ResourceOptions<T, S = unknown> = {
	initialValue?: T
	name?: string
	deferStream?: boolean
	ssrLoadFrom?: "initial" | "server"
	storage?: (
		init: T | undefined
	) => [Accessor<T | undefined>, Setter<T | undefined>]
	onHydrated?: (k: S | undefined, info: { value: T | undefined }) => void
}

function createResource<T, U = true>(
	fetcher: (
		k: U,
		info: { value: T | undefined; refetching: boolean | unknown }
	) => T | Promise<T>,
	options?: ResourceOptions<T, U>
): ResourceReturn<T>

function createResource<T, U>(
	source: U | false | null | (() => U | false | null),
	fetcher: (
		k: U,
		info: { value: T | undefined; refetching: boolean | unknown }
	) => T | Promise<T>,
	options?: ResourceOptions<T, U>
): ResourceReturn<T>

```

`createResource` takes an asynchronous fetcher function and returns a signal that is updated with the resulting data when the fetcher completes.

There are two ways to use `createResource`: you can pass the fetcher function as the sole argument, or you can additionally pass a source signal as the first argument. 
The source signal will retrigger the fetcher whenever it changes, and its value will be passed to the fetcher.

```tsx
const [data, { mutate, refetch }] = createResource(fetchData)
```

```tsx
const [data, { mutate, refetch }] = createResource(source, fetchData)
```

In these snippets, the fetcher is the function `fetchData`, and `data()` is undefined until `fetchData` finishes resolving. 
In the first case, `fetchData` will be called immediately. 
In the second, `fetchData` will be called as soon as `source` has any value other than false, null, or undefined. 
It will be called again whenever the value of `source` changes, and that value will always be passed to `fetchData` as its first argument.

You can call `mutate` to directly update the `data` signal (it works like any other signal setter). 
You can also call refetch to rerun the fetcher directly, and pass an optional argument to provide additional info to the fetcher e.g `refetch(info)`.

`data` works like a normal signal getter: use `data()` to read the last returned value of `fetchData`. 
But it also has extra reactive properties: `data.loading` tells you if the fetcher has been called but not returned, and `data.error` tells you if the request has errored out; if so, it contains the error thrown by the fetcher. 
(Note: if you anticipate errors, you may want to wrap `createResource` in an [ErrorBoundary](/reference/components/error-boundary).)

As of **v1.4.0**, `data.latest` will return the last returned value and won't trigger [Suspense](/reference/components/suspense) and [transitions](#TODO); if no value has been returned yet, `data.latest` acts the same as `data()`. 
This can be useful if you want to show the out-of-date data while the new data is loading.

`loading`, `error`, and `latest` are reactive getters and can be tracked.

## The fetcher

The `fetcher` is the async function that you provide to `createResource` to actually fetch the data.
It is passed two arguments: the value of the source signal (if provided), and an info object with two properties: `value` and `refetching`. 
The `value` property tells you the previously fetched value. 
The `refetching` property is true if the `fetcher` was triggered using the refetch function and false otherwise. 
If the `refetch` function was called with an argument (`refetch(info)`), refetching is set to that argument.

```tsx
async function fetchData(source, { value, refetching }) {
	// Fetch the data and return a value.
	//`source` tells you the current value of the source signal;
	//`value` tells you the last returned value of the fetcher;
	//`refetching` is true when the fetcher is triggered by calling `refetch()`,
	// or equal to the optional data passed: `refetch(info)`
}

const [data, { mutate, refetch }] = createResource(getQuery, fetchData)

// read value
data()

// check if loading
data.loading

// check if errored
data.error

// directly set value without creating promise
mutate(optimisticValue)

// refetch the last request explicitly
refetch()

```

## Version 1.4.0 and Later

#### v1.4.0

If you're using `renderToStream`, you can tell Solid to wait for a resource before flushing the stream using the `deferStream` option:

```tsx
// fetches a user and streams content as soon as possible
const [user] = createResource(() => params.id, fetchUser)

// fetches a user but only streams content after this resource has loaded
const [user] = createResource(() => params.id, fetchUser, {
	deferStream: true,
})
```

#### v1.5.0

1. We've added a new state field which covers a more detailed view of the Resource state beyond `loading` and `error`. 
You can now check whether a Resource is `unresolved`, `pending`, `ready`, `refreshing`, or `error`.

| State        | Value resolved | Loading | Has error |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------- | --------- |
| `unresolved` | No             | No      | No        |
| `pending`    | No             | Yes     | No        |
| `ready`      | Yes            | No      | No        |
| `refreshing` | Yes            | Yes     | No        |
| `error`      | No             | No      | Yes       |

2. When server rendering resources especially when fetching when embedding Solid in other system that fetch before render, you might want to initiate the resource with this prefetched value instead of fetching again and having the resource serialize it in it's own state.
You can use the new `ssrLoadFrom` option for this. 
Instead of using the default `server` value, you can pass `initial` and the resource will use `initialValue` as if it were the result of the first fetch for both SSR and hydration.

```tsx
const [data, { mutate, refetch }] = createResource(() => params.id, fetchUser, {
	initialValue: preloadedData,
	ssrLoadFrom: "initial",
})
```

3. Resources can be set with custom defined storage with the same signature as a Signal by using the storage option. 
For example using a custom reconciling store could be done this way:

```tsx
function createDeepSignal<T>(value: T): Signal<T> {
	const [store, setStore] = createStore({
		value,
	})
	return [
		() => store.value,
		(v: T) => {
			const unwrapped = unwrap(store.value)
			typeof v === "function" && (v = v(unwrapped))
			setStore("value", reconcile(v))
			return store.value
		},
	] as Signal<T>
}

const [resource] = createResource(fetcher, {
	storage: createDeepSignal,
})
```

This option is still experimental and may change in the future.

## Options

The `createResource` function takes an optional third argument, an options object. The options are:

| Name         | Type                    | Default        | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name         | `string`                | `undefined`    | A name for the resource. This is used for debugging purposes.                                                                                                 |
| deferStream  | `boolean`               | `false`        | If true, Solid will wait for the resource to resolve before flushing the stream.                                                                              |
| initialValue | `any`                   | `undefined`    | The initial value of the resource.                                                                                                                            |
| onHydrated   | `function`              | `undefined`    | A callback that is called when the resource is hydrated.                                                                                                      |
| ssrLoadFrom  | `"server" \| "initial"` | `"server"`     | The source of the initial value for SSR. If set to `"initial"`, the resource will use the `initialValue` option instead of the value returned by the fetcher. |
| storage      | `function`              | `createSignal` | A function that returns a signal. This can be used to create a custom storage for the resource. This is still experimental                                    |
