## Try Solid online

To experiment with Solid directly in your browser, head over to our [interactive playground](https://playground.solidjs.com/).
Prefer a full development setup? You can set up a complete environment using StackBlitz.
Start with the [TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/ts) or [JavaScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/templates/tree/master/js) templates.

## Create a Solid project

:::info[Prerequisites]

- Familiarity with the command line.
- An updated [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) or [Deno](https://deno.com) installation.

:::

To create a new Solid application, start by installing the Solid CLI.
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run the following command:

```package-create
solid
```

This command installs and runs [create-solid](https://github.com/solidjs-community/solid-cli/tree/main/packages/create-solid), the official project scaffolding tool for Solid.
The CLI will guide you through a series of prompts, allowing you to choose options such as [starter templates](https://github.com/solidjs/templates), TypeScript support, and whether to include [Solid's full-stack framework, SolidStart](/solid-start):

```shell
◆ Project Name
|  <solid-project>

◆ Is this a SolidStart project?
|  ● Yes / ○ No

◆ Which template would you like to use?
│  ● ts
│  ○ ts-vitest
│  ○ ts-uvu
│  ○ ts-unocss
│  ○ ts-tailwindcss

◆ Use TypeScript?
│  ● Yes / ○ No
```

Once the project is created, follow the instructions to install the dependencies and start the development server:

```sh title="npm" tab="package-manager"
│  cd solid-project
│  npm install
│  npm run dev
```

```sh title="pnpm" tab="package-manager"
│  cd solid-project
│  pnpm install
│  pnpm dev
```

```sh title="yarn" tab="package-manager"
│  cd solid-project
│  yarn install
│  yarn dev
```

```sh title="bun" tab="package-manager"
│  cd solid-project
│  bun install
│  bun run dev
```

```sh title="deno" tab="package-manager"
│  cd solid-project
│  deno install
│  deno run dev
```

You should now have your Solid project running!
