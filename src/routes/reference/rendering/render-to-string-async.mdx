title: renderToStringAsync
---

```ts
import { renderToStringAsync } from "solid-js/web"

function renderToStringAsync<T>(
	fn: () => T,
	options?: {
		timeoutMs?: number
		renderId?: string
		nonce?: string
	}
): Promise<string>

```

Same as `renderToString` except that it will wait for all `<Suspense>` boundaries to resolve before returning the results.
Resource data is automatically serialized into the script tag and will be hydrated on client load.

`renderId` is used to namespace renders when having multiple top level roots.

```ts
const html = await renderToStringAsync(App)
```

## Options

### `timeoutMs`

**Type**: `number`

The number of milliseconds to wait for a `<Suspense>` boundary to resolve before timing out.

### `renderId`

**Type**: `string`

The id to use for the render.

### `nonce`

**Type**: `string`

The nonce to use for the script tag.
