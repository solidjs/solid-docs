title: "Config-based routing"
---

Solid Router allows for configuration-based routing, where JSX is not needed to set up routes. 

To define a single route, a route definition object can be passed to the [`<Router>`](/solid-router/reference/components/router) component:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";

const routes = {
		path: "/",
		component: import("/routes/index.js"),
	}


render(() => <Router>{routes}</Router>, document.getElementById("app"));
```

In the route definition object, a `path` property must be provided to define the path to match and a `component` property that specifies the component (or element) to render when the path matches.

To define multiple routes, an array of route definition objects can be passed to the `<Router>`] component:

```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";

const routes = [
    {
		path: "/",
		component: import("/routes/index.js"),
	},
    {
        path: "/hello-world",
        component: <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    },
    {
        path: "/about",
        component: import("/routes/about.js"),
    }
]


render(() => <Router>{routes}</Router>, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Each path in the array of route definition objects will be matched against the current URL, and the corresponding component will be rendered when a match is found.
In the example above, the root path (`/`) renders the `Home` page, the path `/hello-world` renders an `h1` element, and the path `/about` renders the `About` component.

<Callout title="Lazy Loading">
While not necessary, when using configuration-based routing, it is best practice to use the [`lazy`](/reference/component-apis/lazy) component to load components asynchronously. 
This will help improve the performance of your application by only loading the components when they are needed.

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";

const routes = [
    {
		path: "/",
		component: lazy(() => import("/routes/index.js")),
	},
    {
        path: "/hello-world",
        component: <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    },
    {
        path: "/about",
        component: lazy(() => import("/routes/about.js")),
    }
]


render(() => <Router>{routes}</Router>, document.getElementById("app"));
```
