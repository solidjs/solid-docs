[Railway](https://railway.app/) is a well-known platform for deploying a variety of web and cloud-based projects.
For an in-depth look at the features offered by Railway, as well as detailed deployment guidelines, you can consult the [Railway documentation](https://docs.railway.app/).

## Adjust the Start command

To begin, you need to update the start command in your `package.json` file to make it compatible with Railway.
Change the start command to `npx http-server ./dist` instead of using `vite`.
This adjustment means you will need to build the app to generate the `dist` folder.

For local development, continue using the original `dev` command.
Reserve the modified start command specifically for Railway deployments.
Below is an example of how your `package.json` may be configured:

```jsonl
"scripts": {
  "start": "npx http-server ./dist",
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "serve": "vite preview",
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
},
```

## Using the Railway Web Interface

1. Visit Railway's homepage and click "Start a New Project."
   You will be redirected to connect with GitHub.
   Log in or create an account using your GitHub credentials and authorize Railway to access your account.

/>

2. After authorization, choose the repository that has your Solid project.
   During this step, you can also add any required environment variables.

/>

3. Once your project is configured, click "Deploy Now."
   After a successful deployment, a confirmation screen will appear.

/>

4. Railway does not automatically assign a domain to your project.
   To do this, go to the settings and manually generate a domain for your deployed project.

	preview="https://app.eraser.io/workspace/w9y9PNVjwSqDCEPNTEoe/preview?elements=2y6TnvBnztCwN8ecamrffQ&type=embed"
/>

Once a domain has been generated, your Solid project should be live.

## Using the Railway CLI

1. Using your preferred package manager and install the Railway CLI:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm i -g @railway/cli
```
</div>

<div id="yarn">```bash frame="none" yarn global add @railway/cli ```</div>

<div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm i -g @railway/cli
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

2. Open your terminal and run the following command to log in:

```bash frame="none"
railway login
```

3. You have the option to link your local Solid project to an existing Railway project using railway link.
   Alternatively, you can create a new project with `railway init` and follow the on-screen prompts.

4. To deploy your project to Railway, use the following command:

```bash frame="none"
railway up
# or
railway up --detach # if you prefer to avoid logs
```

Your project will now be live on Railway.
