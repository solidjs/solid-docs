title: cache
---

Cache is used to prevent duplicate fetching and to trigger handle refetching.
It takes a function and returns the same function.

```jsx
const getUser = cache((id) => {
  return (await fetch(`/api/users${id}`)).json()
}, "users") // used as cache key + serialized arguments
```

It is expected that the arguments to the cache function are serializable.

This cache accomplishes the following:

1. Deduping on the server for the lifetime of the request.
2. Preloading the cache in the browser - this lasts 10 seconds.
   When a route is preloaded on hover or when load is called when entering a route it will make sure to dedupe calls.
3. A reactive refetch mechanism based on key.
   This prevents routes that are not new from retriggering on action revalidation.
4. Serve as a back/forward cache for browser navigation for up to 5 minutes.
   Any user based navigation or link click bypasses it.
   Upon revalidation or new fetch the cache is updated.

Using it with a load function:

```js
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { Route } from "@solidjs/router";
import { getUser } from ... // the cache function

const User = lazy(() => import("./pages/users/[id].js"));

// load function
function loadUser({params, location}) {
  void getUser(params.id)
}

// Pass it in the route definition
<Route path="/users/:id" component={User} load={loadUser} />;
```

Inside your page component you:

```jsx
// pages/users/[id].js
import { getUser } from ... // the cache function

export default function User(props) {
  const user = createAsync(() => getUser(props.params.id));
  return <h1>{user().name}</h1>;
}
```

Cached functions provide a few useful methods for getting the key that can be used in cases with invalidation:

```ts
let id = 5;

getUser.key; // returns "users"
getUser.keyFor(id); // returns "users[5]"
```

The cache can be revalidated using the `revalidate` method or the `revalidate` keys that are set on the response from the actions.
If the whole key is passed, it will invalidate all entries for the cache (ie. `users` in the example above).
If only a single entry needs to be invalidated, `keyFor` is provided.

  `cache` can be defined anywhere and then used inside your components with [`createAsync`](/solid-router/reference/data-apis/create-async).

However, using `cache` directly in [`createResource`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-resource) will not work since the fetcher is not reactive and will not invalidate properly.
