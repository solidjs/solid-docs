title: A
---

Like the [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) tag but supports relative paths and active class styling (requires client side JavaScript).

The `<A>` tag has an `active` class if its href matches the current location, and `inactive` otherwise.
**Note:** By default matching includes locations that are descendents (eg. href `/users` matches locations `/users` and `/users/123`), use the boolean `end` prop to prevent matching these.
This is particularly useful for links to the root route `/` which would match everything.

| prop          | type    | description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| href          | string  | The path of the route to navigate to. This will be resolved relative to the route that the link is in, but you can preface it with `/` to refer back to the root.                        |
| noScroll      | boolean | If true, turn off the default behavior of scrolling to the top of the new page                                                                                                           |
| replace       | boolean | If true, don't add a new entry to the browser history. (By default, the new page will be added to the browser history, so pressing the back button will take you to the previous route.) |
| state         | unknown | [Push this value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState) to the history stack when navigating                                                               |
| inactiveClass | string  | The class to show when the link is inactive (when the current location doesn't match the link)                                                                                           |
| activeClass   | string  | The class to show when the link is active                                                                                                                                                |
| end           | boolean | If `true`, only considers the link to be active when the current location matches the `href` exactly; if `false`, check if the current location _starts with_ `href`                     |
