  Execute effects immediately during rendering with createRenderEffect. Run side
  effects as DOM creates, before refs are set or connected.
---

The `createRenderEffect` primitive creates a reactive computation that automatically tracks reactive values, such as signals, accessed within the provided function.
This function re-runs whenever any of its dependencies change.

In contrast to [`createEffect`](/reference/basic-reactivity/create-effect), which executes after the rendering phase is complete, `createRenderEffect` runs immediately during the component's rendering phase.

## Execution Timing

- The initial execution of a render effect occurs **during the current rendering phase**.
  It runs while DOM elements are being created and updated, but **before they are mounted**.

  As a result, refs are **not set** before the render effect runs for the first time.

- After the initial run, the order in which render effects run is **not guaranteed**.
- When multiple dependencies are updated within the same batch, the render effect will only run once.
- Render effects always run **after** any pure computations (such as [memos](/concepts/derived-values/memos)) within the same update cycle.

## Import

```ts
import { createRenderEffect } from "solid-js";
```

## Type

```ts
function createRenderEffect<Next>(
	fn: EffectFunction<undefined | NoInfer<Next>, Next>
): void;
function createRenderEffect<Next, Init = Next>(
	fn: EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>,
	value: Init,
	options?: { name?: string }
): void;
function createRenderEffect<Next, Init>(
	fn: EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>,
	value?: Init,
	options?: { name?: string }
): void;
```

## Parameters

### `fn`

- **Type:** `EffectFunction<undefined | NoInfer<Next> | EffectFunction<Init | Next, Next>`
- **Required:** Yes

The function to execute as the render effect.
It receives the value returned from the previous execution, or the initial `value` during its the first run.
The value returned by this function will be passed to the next execution.

### `value`

- **Type:** `Init`
- **Required:** No

The initial value that is passed to `fn` during its first execution.

### `options`

- **Type:** `{ name?: string }`
- **Required:** No

An optional configuration object with the following properties:

#### `name`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Required:** No

A name for the render effect, which can be useful for identification in debugging tools like the [Solid Debugger](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools).

## Return value

`createRenderEffect` does not return a value.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { createSignal, createRenderEffect } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

	// This runs immediately during render, and re-runs when the count changes.
	createRenderEffect(() => {
		console.log("Count: ", count());
	});

	return (
		<div>
			<p>Count: {count()}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```

### Execution Timing

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect, createRenderEffect } from "solid-js";

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

	// This is part of the component's synchronous execution.
	console.log("Hello from counter");

	// This effect is scheduled to run after the initial render is complete.
	createEffect(() => {
		console.log("Effect:", count());
	});

	// By contrast, a render effect runs synchronously during the render phase.
	createRenderEffect(() => {
		console.log("Render effect:", count());
	});

	// Setting a signal during the render phase re-runs render effects, but not effects, which are
	// still scheduled.
	setCount(1);

	// A microtask is scheduled to run after the current synchronous code (the render phase) finishes.
	queueMicrotask(() => {
		// Now that rendering is complete, signal updates will trigger effects immediately.
		setCount(2);
	});
}

// Output:
// Hello from counter
// Render effect: 0
// Render effect: 1
// Effect: 1
// Render effect: 2
// Effect: 2
```
