  Navigate programmatically with useNavigate - redirect users, handle auth
  flows, and control navigation with replace and scroll options.

Retrieves the method which accepts a path to navigate to and an optional object with the following options:

- resolve (_boolean_, default `true`): resolve the path against the current route
- replace (_boolean_, default `false`): replace the history entry
- scroll (_boolean_, default `true`): scroll to top after navigation
- state (_any_, default `undefined`): pass custom state to `location.state`

```js
const navigate = useNavigate();

if (unauthorized) {
	navigate("/login", { replace: true });
}
```

If you are inside of a query, action or cache (deprecated) function you will instead want to use [redirect](/solid-router/reference/response-helpers/redirect) or [reload](/solid-router/reference/response-helpers/reload).

:::note
	The state is serialized using the [structured clone
	algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm)
	which does not support all object types.
