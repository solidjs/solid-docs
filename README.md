## What is Solid?

Solid is a JavaScript framework used for building high-performance
user-interfaces. Using a reactive approach and component-based architecture, we
want to empower developers in creating efficient and scalable web applications.

## Running the Site Locally

At the moment, we recommend running the site locally through either
[﻿CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/solidjs/solid-docs-next/),
[﻿Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next), or
[﻿StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/solid-docs-next). These are
the quickest and easiest way to browse and edit the project files and run the
site locally.

The app uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the package manager and it runs on Node.js `v18+`.

Install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

And run the local dev server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This will start your the app at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or the next available port.

### Collections and virtual modules

The builds an [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) inspired collection navigation, it will bring all routes and generate a couple of files at `/.solid`.
These files are exposed to your app via [Vite virtual modules](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin#virtual-modules-convention). This task is perform via our `sync` script (`pnpm sync`), ran before every build.

If changes are made to the navigation (new entry, or repositioning entry), it is necessary to restart the server for changes to take effect.
