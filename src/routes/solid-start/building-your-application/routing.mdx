title: "Routing"

Routing serves as a key component to web applications.
Within SolidStart, there are two types:

- **UI routes** &mdash; define the user interface in your app
- **[API routes](/solid-start/building-your-application/api-routes)** &mdash; define the serverless functions in your app

To read more about API routes, [see the API Routes section.](/solid-start/building-your-application/api-routes)

## Creating new routes

SolidStart uses file based routing which is a way of defining your routes by creating files and folders in your project.
This includes your pages and API routes.

SolidStart traverses your `routes` directory, collects all of the routes, and then makes them accessible using the [`<FileRoutes />`](/solid-start/reference/routing/file-routes).
This component will only include your UI routes, and not your API routes.
Rather than manually defining each `Route` inside a `Router` component, `<FileRoutes />` will generate the routes for you based on the file system.

Because `<FileRoutes />` returns a routing config object, you can use it with the router of your choice.
In this example we use [`solid-router`](/solid-router):

```tsx {7-9} title="app.tsx"
import { Suspense } from "solid-js";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";

export default function App() {
	return (
		<Router root={(props) => <Suspense>{props.children}</Suspense>}>
			<FileRoutes />
		</Router>
	);
}
```

The `<Router />` component expects a `root` prop which functions as the root layout of your entire app.
You will want to make sure `props.children` is wrapped in `<Suspense />` because each component will be lazy loaded automatically for you. Without this you may see some unexpected hydration errors.

`<FileRoutes />` will generate a route for each file in the `routes` directory and its subdirectories. For a route to be rendered as a page, it must default export a component.
This component represents the content that will be rendered when users visit the page:

```tsx filename="routes/index.tsx"
export default function Index() {
	return <div>Welcome to my site!</div>;
}
```

This means that all you have to do is create a file in your `routes` folder and SolidStart takes care of everything else needed to make that route available to visit in your application!

## File based routing

Each file in the `routes` directory is treated as a route.
To create a new route or page in your application, simply create a new file in the `routes` directory.
The file name will be the URL path for the route:

- `example.com/blog` ➜ `/routes/blog.tsx`
- `example.com/contact` ➜ `/routes/contact.tsx`
- `example.com/directions` ➜ `/routes/directions.tsx`

### Nested routes

If you need nested routes, you can create a directory with the name of the preceding route segment, and create new files in that directory:

- `example.com/blog/article-1` ➜ `/routes/blog/article-1.tsx`
- `example.com/work/job-1` ➜ `/routes/work/job-1.tsx`

When a file is named `index`, it will be rendered when there are no additional URL route segments being requested for a matching directory:

- `example.com` ➜ `/routes/index.tsx`
- `example.com/socials` ➜ `/routes/socials/index.tsx`

### Nested layouts

If you want to create nested layouts you can create a file with the same name as a route folder.

```jsx {2}
|-- routes/   
    |-- blog.tsx                   // layout file
    |-- blog/
        |-- article-1.tsx         // example.com/blog/article-1
        |-- article-2.tsx        // example.com/blog/article-2
```

In this case the `blog.tsx` file will act as a layout for the articles in the `blog` folder. You can reference the child content
by using `props.children` in the layout.

```tsx filename="routes/blog.tsx"
import { RouteSectionProps } from "@solidjs/router";

export default function BlogLayout(props: RouteSectionProps) {
	return <div>{props.childen}</div>;
}
```

**Note**: Creating a `blog/index.tsx` or `blog/(blogIndex).tsx` is not the same as it would only be used for the index route.

## Renaming Index

By default, the component that is rendered for a route comes from the default export of the `index.tsx` file in each folder.
However, this can make it difficult to find the correct `index.tsx` file when searching, since there will be multiple files with that name.

To avoid this, you can rename the `index.tsx` file to the name of the folder it is in, enclosed in parenthesis.

This way, it will be treated as the default export for that route:

```jsx {9}
|-- routes/                       // example.com
    |-- blog/
        |-- article-1.tsx         // example.com/blog/article-1
        |-- article-2.tsx
    |-- work/
        |-- job-1.tsx             // example.com/work/job-1
        |-- job-2.tsx
    |-- socials/
        |-- (socials).tsx           // example.com/socials
```

#### Escaping nested routes

When you have a path that is nested but wish for it to have a separate Layout, you can escape the nested route by applying a name between `( )`.
This will allow you to create a new route that is not nested under the previous route:

```jsx {5-6}
|-- routes/                       // example.com
    |-- users/
        |-- index.tsx            // example.com/users
        |-- projects.tsx         // example.com/projects
    |-- users(details)/
        |-- [id].tsx            // example.com/users/1
```

Additionally, you can incorporate nested layouts of their own:

```tsx {2, 78}
|-- routes/
    |-- users.tsx
    |-- users(details).tsx
    |-- users/
        |-- index.tsx
        |-- projects.tsx
    |-- users(details)/
        |-- [id].tsx
```

### Dynamic routes

Dynamic routes are routes that can match any value for one segment of the route.
When your URL path contains a dynamic segment, square brackets (`[]`) are used to define the dynamic segment:

- `example.com/users/:id` ➜ `/routes/users/[id].tsx`
- `example.com/users/:id/:name` ➜ `/routes/users/[id]/[name].tsx`
- `example.com/*missing` ➜ `/routes/[...missing].tsx`

This allows you to create a single route that can match any value for that segment of the URL path.
For example, `/users/1` and `/users/2` are both valid routes and rather than defining separate routes for each user, you can use a dynamic route to match any value for the `id` segment.

```tsx {3}
|-- routes/
    |-- users/
        |-- [id].tsx
```

For example, using `solid-router`, you could use the [`useParams`](/solid-router/reference/primitives/use-params) hook to match the dynamic segment:

```tsx title="routes/users/[id].tsx"
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";

export default function UserPage() {
	const params = useParams();
	return <div>User {params.id}</div>;
}
```

#### Optional parameter

If you have optional parameters in your route, you can use the double square brackets (`[[id]]`) to define the dynamic segment.
This will match a route with or without a parameter.

```tsx {3}
|-- routes/
    |-- users/
        |-- [[id]].tsx
```

In this case, some pages that could be matched include:

- `/users`
- `/users/1`
- `/users/abc`

#### Catch-all routes

Catch-all routes are a special type of dynamic route that can match any number of segments.
They are defined using square brackets with `...` before the label for the route (e.g. `[...post]`).

```tsx {4}
|-- routes/
    |-- blog/
        |-- index.tsx
        |-- [...post].tsx
```

A catch-all route will have one parameter which is a forward-slash delimited string of all the URL segments after the last valid segment.
For example, with the route `[..post]` and a URL path of `/post/foo` the `params` object returned from the `useParams` primitive will have a `post` property with the value of `foo`.
For a URL path of `/post/foo/baz` it will be `foo/baz`.

```tsx title="routes/blog/[...post].tsx"
import { useParams } from "@solidjs/router";

export default function BlogPage() {
	const params = useParams();
	return <div>Blog {params.post}</div>;
}
```

## Route groups

Using route groups, you can organize your routes in a way that makes sense for your application, without affecting the URL structure.
Since file-based routing is based on the file system, it can be difficult to organize your routes in a way that makes sense for your application.

In SolidStart, route groups are defined by using parenthesis (`()`) surrounding the folder name:

```tsx {2}
|-- routes/
    |-- (static)
        |-- about-us                // example.com/about-us
            |-- index.tsx
        |-- contact-us              // example.com/contact-us
            |-- index.tsx
```

## Additional route config

SolidStart offers a way to add additional route configuration outside of the file system.
Since SolidStart supports the use of other routers, you can use the `route` export provided by `<FileRoutes />` to define the route configuration for the router of your choice.

```jsx {3-7}
import type { RouteSectionProps, RouteDefinition } from "@solidjs/router";

export const route = {
  preload() {
    // define preload function
  }
} satisfies RouteDefinition

export default function UsersLayout(props: RouteSectionProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}
```
