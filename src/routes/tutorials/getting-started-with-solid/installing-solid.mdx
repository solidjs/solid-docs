# Installing Solid

There are several ways to get up and running with Solid.

## In the browser

The easiest way to get started with Solid is to choose a browser-based option:

1. **Use the Solid playground.** The playground is a browser-based REPL that already has Solid loaded up and ready to go. [Use the Solid playground](https://playground.solidjs.com/)

2. **Use the Solid StackBlitz starters.** StackBlitz is a web application that provides an interface similar to Visual Studio Code. You can choose from either the [JavaScript starter](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-byctbg?file=src/App.jsx) or the [Typescript starter](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-vgroct?file=src/App.tsx).

## In your local environment

You can run Solid in your local development environment if you have Node installed. If you don't, you can install it for free at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

Assuming you have Node installed, we recommend using one of our [Vite templates](https://github.com/solidjs/templates) by running these commands in your terminal:

### JavaScript template

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/js my-app
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn or pnpm
npm run dev # or yarn or pnpm
```

### Typescript template

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/ts my-app
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn or pnpm
npm run dev # or yarn or pnpm
```

If everything has been installed correctly, the final command should start the demo application on port 3000. Navigate to [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) and you should see the following demo app:
