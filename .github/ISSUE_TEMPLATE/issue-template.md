A good issue is _descriptive_ and _explanatory_: it describes precisely what the problem is and why it is a problem.

**For reporting bugs and problems with content, include:**

- A description of the problem
- A link to the page that has the problem
- An explanation as to why this is a problem. Ideally, explain _who_ is affected by this. "It was confusing for me" _is_ a valid answer to this!
- A suggestion of a fix, if you have one in mind!


**For suggesting new content**:
- If you're suggesting an addition to an existing page, explain what is missing and why this is a problem.
- If you're suggesting a new content page, make sure to explain which [content type](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/blob/main/WRITING.md#content-types) the page should be.
- Refer to our [writing guide](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/blob/main/WRITING.md) for our baseline content standards.
