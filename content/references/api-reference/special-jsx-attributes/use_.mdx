These are custom directives. In a sense this is just syntax sugar over ref but allows us to easily attach multiple directives to a single element. A directive is a function with the following signature:

```ts
function directive(element: Element, accessor: () => any): void;
```

Directive functions are called at render time but before being added to the DOM. You can do whatever you'd like in them including create signals, effects, register clean-up etc.

```tsx
const [name, setName] = createSignal("");

function model(el, value) {
  const [field, setField] = value();
  createRenderEffect(() => (el.value = field()));
  el.addEventListener("input", (e) => setField(e.target.value));
}

<input type="text" use:model={[name, setName]} />;
```

To register with TypeScript extend the JSX namespace.

```ts
declare module "solid-js" {
  namespace JSX {
    interface Directives {
      model: [() => any, (v: any) => any];
    }
  }
}
```
