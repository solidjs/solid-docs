<title>Adding Interactivity with State</title>

# Adding Interactivity with State

In the previous lesson, we learned how to architect a Solid application using components and JSX. We then built a Bookshelf application using our new knowledge, but it's not quite complete. In this lesson, we'll learn about some building blocks that help us _manage application state_. We will then apply this knowledge to our Bookshelf application to bring it to life.

## A note on primitives

As we proceed through these tutorials, we'll start hearing about Solid _primitives_. Primitives are the building blocks of Solid applications. The first primitive that we'll be learning about is the _signal_.

## Managing basic state with signals

In Solid, the most basic way to manage state in our application is to use a _signal_. To create a signal, Solid provides a `createSignal` function:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
```

There's a lot going on here: first, we call `createSignal` with the initial value of state. In this case, our `count` is going to start at `0`. The `createSignal` function returns a two-element array and we use JavaScript _destructuring assignment_ to unpack this array. In this case, we assign the first element to a variable called `count` and the second element to a variable called `setCount`.

The first element, `count`, is an _accessor_ function (also referred to as a _getter_) that returns the current value of state.

It's important to note that this is a _function that gets the current value_, rather than the value itself. Along the way, this function call tells Solid to take note that we've accessed the signal here.

```tsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

console.log(count()); // 0
```

<FrameworkAside framework="svelte">
  This is equivalent to `let count = 0` in Svelte. 
  
  In Svelte, you can use your
  reactive value without calling it like a function. That's because Svelte's
  reactivity uses a compiler, whereas Solid's reactivity is part of the library.
  Because we're working within the restrictions of JavaScript, we need to run code when we access the value so that we can 
  tell the reactive system, "This value is used here!"
</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="react">
This is equivalent to `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)` in React.

In React, you can use your reactive value without calling it like a function.
That's because React's rendering system will rerun your entire component any time any state changes - there's nothing special to set up for any individual piece of state, so there's no need to run any code when you use a reactive value.

</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="vue">
This is equivalent to `const count = ref(0)` in Vue.

Instead of splitting count into a getter function and a setter function, Vue has you use `count.value` for both getting and setting
the value. Vue's reactive system is similar to Solid's: we need to run code behind the scenes whenever a `ref` is accessed.
In Vue, this code lives inside the `.value` [getter function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get).

</FrameworkAside>

The second element, `setCount`, is a _setter_ function. If we want to increment our `count`, we can pass `count() + 1` to `setCount`:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

setCount(count() + 1);

console.log(count()); // 1
```

Note that, in order to see our `count` value's new value, we added our `console.log` statement after we used `setCount`.

A key to Solid's _reactive system_ is that we don't really have to do this. Instead, we can listen for&mdash;and instantly react to&mdash;any signal changes by using our next primitive: the _effect_.

## Reacting to changes with effects

The ability to react to signal changes underpins Solid's reactive system. The most basic way to do so is to use an _effect_. We can create an effect by using the `createEffect` hook:

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

createEffect(() => {
  console.log(count());
});

setCount(count() + 1);
```

To use `createEffect`, we pass it a function. When any signals used in that function update, the function will rerun.

In this example, our effect depends on `count` and therefore the effect runs whenever `count` changes. Accordingly, we log `1` to the console just like before.

Automatic effect dependency tracking is made possible by `count` being a function. When the `count` function is called inside an effect, that effect is registered as a listener for the signal. This is why it's so important that our signals are functions!

<FrameworkAside framework="svelte">
  This is equivalent to `$: console.log(count)` in Svelte.
</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="react">
  In React, you'd declare the dependencies explicitly using the dependency array:
  ```js
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log(count);
    }, [count])
  ```
    If you didn't, the effect would rerun whenever _any_ state in the component changes.
    In Solid, dependencies are tracked automatically, and you don't have to worry about extra reruns.
</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="vue">
  This is equivalent to `watchEffect(() => console.log(count.value))` in Vue.
</FrameworkAside>

## Rendering with signals

Now that we've gained some exposure to two of Solid's core primitives, signals and effects, it's time to add them into our components. Let's keep using our `count` example but, instead of logging the count, let's render it to the DOM:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [{ name: "Counter.jsx", component: Counter1 }],
    tsx: [{ name: "Counter.tsx", component: Counter1 }],
  }}
/>

<div>Current count: 0</div>

We see that, much like other variables, we can use signals inside our JSX code by including them inside curly braces. This component is not too interesting yet; so let's add the ability to increment our count. We can do this by adding a `<button>` element and giving it a _click handler_ using the `onClick` prop. This click handler will increment our count by using the `setCount` function:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [{ name: "Counter.jsx", component: Counter2 }],
    tsx: [{ name: "Counter.tsx", component: Counter2 }],
  }}
/>

<BasicCounter />

And now we have a functioning counter! Notably, our DOM updates whenever our `count` is incremented. Does this remind you of an effect? It should! In Solid, rendering is treated as an effect. A driving philosophy of Solid is that, by treating everything as a signal or an effect, we can better reason about our application.

Solid offers some other primitives to help with state management, but they're a bit too advanced for an introductory tutorial.

## Revisting the bookshelf

We now have the tools necessary to make our Bookshelf application interactive. As a refresher, here's the current state of the app with the following components:

- `BookList`, a list of books on our Bookshelf
- `AddBook`, a form that will allow us to add more books to the shelf
- `Bookshelf`, our main application component that contains the other two

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList1 },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList1 },
    ],
  }}
/>

As a first step to adding interactivity, let's add a signal that keeps track of our book list. We'll call it `books` and it will live in the `BookList` component. Each book will have a `title` and an `author`.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList2js, default: true },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList2ts, default: true },
    ],
  }}
/>

There are a couple things to note here:

First, while we had only used `createSignal` to maintain the value of a number in state thus far, it can manage all kinds of state. In our Bookshelf application, our signal is an array of objects.

Second, we're now using `books` directly in our JSX code. We call `books()` to access the signal array, and then access the element at index 0 (zero) of that array in the first list item and the element at index 1 of that array in the second list item. This will work, but it's not flexible: we want to handle a dynamic number of books.

## Looping over items

The best way to loop over items in Solid is the `<For />` component. The `<For />` component has an `each` prop, to which we can pass our `books()` array.

```tsx
<For each={books()}></For>
```

Inside the `For` component, we use a _callback function_ that will be applied to _each_ element in the array. In this instance, we want each `book` to be rendered inside an `<li>`.

```tsx
<For each={books()}>
  {(book) => {
    return (
      <li>
        {book.title} ({book.author})
      </li>
    );
  }}
</For>
```

Our `BookList` component now looks like this:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList3js, default: true },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList3ts, default: true },
    ],
  }}
/>

## Derived state

Solid makes it easy to track _derived state_. You can think of derived state as a computation based only on other information you're already tracking in state. In our Bookshelf application, an example of derived state would be the number of books on our list: it's the length of our `books` array at any point in time.

In Solid, all we have to do to compute derived state is to create a _derived signal_: a function that relies on another signal:

```tsx
const totalBooks = () => books().length;
```

Now, our `totalBooks` function is a signal of its own and will always be up-to-date with the length of our `books` array.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList4js, default: true },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList4ts, default: true },
    ],
  }}
/>

## Lifting state up

We want to add a book to the list using our `AddBook` component. There's one problem though: how do we make the `setBooks` setter available to the `AddBooks` component?

We know that parents can pass props to children, but how do _sibling_ components pass props to each other? This is a common problem in Solid and the solution is generally to _lift state up_ to a common parent. In this case, our `books` signal can live in the `Bookshelf` component. Then, the `BookList` component can use the accessor (`books()`) and the `AddBook` component can use the setter (`setBooks`).

Let's start out by lifting our `books` signal up to `Bookshelf` and passing it back down to the `BookList` component. You can see the changes we have made in both the `App.tsx` and `BookList.tsx` files.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App3js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App3ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
    ],
  }}
/>

Our array of books now lives in the `Bookshelf` component. We then pass `books()` to the `BookList` component. We can now access our books withing the `BookList` component by using `props.books`.

**Note:** You may have noticed that we called `books()` when we passed it to the `BookList` component&mdash;this is not a typo! In Solid, it's a best practice to call a signal accessor when you pass it to a component. In the background, Solid makes this a _reactive prop_ and reactivity will be tracked in the child component's JSX. (_Note: good place to link to a discussion/guide on props and reactivity_).

## Adding books to the list

Now that we have lifted state, we can add some books to the list. Let's pass our setter to the `AddBook` component and call `setBooks` when we click the `Add Book` button. You can see these changes in the `App.tsx` and `AddBook.tsx` files:

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx*", component: App4js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx*", component: AddBook2js },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx*", component: App4ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx*", component: AddBook2ts },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
    ],
  }}
/>

Inside `AddBook`, we created a function called `addBook` that is used as the _click handler_ for our form's button. Since we're submitting a real HTML form, we use `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the default form behavior of executing a post request. Next, we call `props.setBooks`, but we don't quite know what to pass to our setter.

We know we want to keep the existing books on the list and then add a new book that comes from our form input. To get the existing books, we could use two different approaches: we _could_ pass the `books` signal down to our `AddBook` component. While that would work, it's worth exploring the second option: using the _callback function_ form of the setter. We haven't used this yet, and the syntax is as follows:

```tsx
setCount((currentCount) => {
  return currentCount + 1;
});
```

By using this form, our setter has access to the current value of the signal.

This form for our `setBooks` function solves the first problem: our `addBook` function can be written as follows:

```jsx
const addBook = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  props.setBooks((books) => {
    return books;
  });
};
```

Now, we need to append the text from our form inputs to this list. To do so, we can create a new signal inside the `AddBook` component to track the value of the inputs. We'll make sure this signal is always equal to the inputs' values by using its `onInput` handler. Additionally, we'll _bind_ the `newBook()` to the `value` attribute of our `input` to make sure our `input` always reflects the value of the signal.

Finally, we want to add the `newBook` to our books list and then clear the input field in case our user has more books to enter.

<CodeTabs
  files={{
    jsx: [
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App4js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx*", component: AddBook3js, default: true },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
    ],
    tsx: [
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App4ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx*", component: AddBook3ts, default: true },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
    ],
  }}
/>

**Note:** We used the spread operator to create an new books array inside our books setter. This is a common pattern in Solid and helps to make sure we create a new array rather than update (or _mutate_) the existing signal array. By default, Solid uses referential equality checks when determining if a signal has updated.

## Test-driving our app

We now have a dynamic Bookshelf application! Try it out yourself: you should be able to add books using the `AddBook` component and see those books added to the list in the `BookList` component.
