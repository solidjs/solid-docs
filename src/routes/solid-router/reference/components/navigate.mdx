title: Navigate
---

Solid Router provides a `Navigate` component that works similarly to [`<A>`](/solid-router/reference/components/a), but it will _immediately_ navigate to the provided path as soon as the component is rendered.
It also uses the `href` prop, but with the additional option of passing a function to `href` that returns a path to navigate to:

```jsx
function getPath({ navigate, location }) {
	// navigate is the result of calling useNavigate(); location is the result of calling useLocation().
	// You can use those to dynamically determine a path to navigate to
	return "/some-path";
}

// Navigating to /redirect will redirect you to the result of getPath
<Route path="/redirect" component={() => <Navigate href={getPath} />} />;
```
