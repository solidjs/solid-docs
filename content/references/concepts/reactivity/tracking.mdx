<Title>Tracking</Title>

**Learn these first:** _signals_, _effects_, _props_

**Tracking** is the mechanism that Solid uses to "keep track" of where a signal was accessed.
This is how it knows which effects to rerun when a given signal changes.

## What you need to know

1. The goal of tracking is to register subscriptions. When an effect "subscribes" to a signal, it will rerun when that signal changes.
2. Tracking happens on access. Whenever a signal (or store value) is accessed inside an effect, the signal is "tracked" and the effect is subscribed to the signal.
3. Tracking doesn't happen everywhere. If you access a signal outside an effect, no tracking will happen. That's because there's no effect to subscribe to the signal.
4. The **tracking rule of thumb**: _access_ a reactive value at the same time that you _use_ it.

This doesn't just apply to signals created with `createSignal` - props and stores work the same way.

## Example

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [getCount, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(getCount() + 1);

  /* When getCount() is called, the "count" signal is tracked as a subscription of this effect,
    so this code reruns when (and only when) count changes */
  createEffect(() => {
    console.log("My effect says " + getCount());
  })

  /* This code isn't in a "tracking scope", so getCount()
     doesn't do anything special and this code never reruns */
  console.log(getCount());

  return (
    /*
      JSX is a tracking scope (it uses effects behind the scenes), so this code
      registers getCount as a subscription when getCount() is called
    */
    <button type="button" onClick={increment}>
      {getCount()}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Tracking Gotchas

Let's look at some examples where we can apply **the tracking rule of thumb** to debug some code.

### Derived State

In this example, the paragraph won't update when `getCount` changes, because `getCount` was accessed outside of a tracking scope.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [getCount, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(getCount() + 1);

  const doubleCount = getCount() * 2;
  return (
    <>
      <p>Twice my count: {doubleCount}</p>
      <button type="button" onClick={increment}>
        {getCount()}
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

The solution is to turn `doubleCount` into a _function_. That way, when `doubleCount` is used
in the JSX, `getCount()` will be called and a subscription will be registered.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [getCount, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(getCount() + 1);

  const doubleCount = () => getCount() * 2;
  return (
    <>
      <p>Twice my count: {doubleCount()}</p>
      <button type="button" onClick={increment}>
        {getCount()}
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Destructuring Props

In this example, the paragraph in DoubleCountView will never update.

```jsx
function DoubleCountView(props) {
  const { value } = props;
  const doubleCount = () => value * 2;
  return <p>{doubleCount()}</p>;
}

function Counter() {
  const [getCount, setCount] = createSignal(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(getCount() + 1);

  return (
    <>
      <DoubleCountView value={getCount()} />
      <button type="button" onClick={increment}>
        {getCount()}
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Here, the reactive value is the `value` prop, passed from the parent. Where is that value accessed?

```jsx
const { value } = props;
```

This destructuring assignment is the only code that actually accesses `props.value`!
After that, `value` just represents the static value that was accessed at that time.

To fix this, we need to make sure we _access_ the value at the same time that we _use_ it.
We can call `props.value` directly:

```jsx
function DoubleCountView(props) {
  const doubleCount = () => props.value * 2;
  return <p>{doubleCount()}</p>;
}
```

Alternatively, we could destructure `props` at the same time that we use it:

```jsx
function DoubleCountView(props) {
  const doubleCount = () => {
    const { value } = props;
    return value * 2;
  };
  return <p>{doubleCount()}</p>;
}
```
