[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is an all-in-one app development platform by Google, offering a range of services from real-time databases to user authentication.
For a detailed overview of the services available, you can visit [Firebase's documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs).

Before proceeding, make sure you've already set up a project in your Firebase console.
If you haven't, you can follow [Firebase's official guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#creating-cloud-projects) to create a new Firebase project.

## Using the Firebase CLI Tool

1. Use your preferred package manager to install the Firebase command-line tool with one of the following commands:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm i -g firebase-tools
```
</div>

<div id="yarn">``` bash yarn global add firebase-tools ```</div>

<div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm i -g firebase-tools
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>

2. Execute the `firebase login` command to ensure that you're logged into the Firebase account associated with your project.

3. In the root directory of your Solid project, create two new files: `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc`.

- In `firebase.json`, add the following code:

```json
{
	"hosting": {
		"public": "dist",
		"ignore": []
	}
}
```

- In `.firebaserc`, insert the following code (replace `<YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>` with your Firebase project ID):

```bash frame="none"
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "<YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>"
  }
}
```

4. Run `npm run build` , followed by `firebase deploy` to build and deploy your project.

Upon completion, a `Hosting URL` will be displayed, indicating the live deployment of your project.
