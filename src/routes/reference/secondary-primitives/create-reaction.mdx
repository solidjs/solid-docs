```ts
import { createReaction } from "solid-js"

function createReaction(onInvalidate: () => void): (fn: () => void) => void

```

Sometimes it is useful to separate tracking from re-execution. 
This primitive registers a side effect that is run the first time the expression wrapped by the returned tracking function is notified of a change.

```ts
const [s, set] = createSignal("start")

const track = createReaction(() => console.log("something"))

// run the reaction next time `s` changes.
track(() => s())

set("end") // "something"

set("final") // no-op since the reaction only runs on the first update, need to call `track` again.
```
